&+W* &=LCI broke Map Vision in to 5 categories:&n

&+W -&n&+YCategory 2:&n Stuff that's really big: Good Ships, Evil Ships, Undead Ships, Neutral Ships, Unknown Ships, Ships, Ferries.

&+W* &nA &+Csilvery&N-colored &+Wpotion&n is no longer &+wmeteorswarm&n.
&+W* &nFixed an exp bug that was reducing killing exp from lower level things to 0, and not providing a bonus for killing higher level things.
&+W* &nWith regards to the neg-pocket incident:
&+W -&nAfter thorough review, &+gLohrr&n has come to the conclusion that bug abuse did, in fact, occur.
&+W -&nPeople were aware that they were doing wrong, and this was an event that had been planned for about a week.
&+W -&nThe abuse of the proc for &+La dense pocket of negative energy&n in the past was punished, albeit the abuse was done using different methods.
&+W -&nThe assumption that you will not be punished for intentionally abusing a bug because it's the first time you abuse it is false.
&+W -&nIf it's something you believe will be changed after it being either reported or otherwise discovered by an Immortal, it is a bug.
&+W -&nAny claims that you will quit playing if something is done or not done will be ignored or punished.  The Immortals are not to be extorted.
&+W -&nWhile &+gLohrr&n would not have known the bug abuse had happened if it weren't for a petition, it would still have been a punishable offense.
&+W -&nAnd, finally, it is up to the Immortals to decide when/how to &+wpunish&n.  This means, if we are in a good mood, and the offense was made on both sides, it is at our discretion to decide whether to &+wpunish&n all offenders or to decide that it's partially or fully a wash.

&+LOc&+wto&+Lber &+G29th, &+r2015
&+W* &nThe exp from &+rcraft&n and &+yforge&N is no longer in the tens of thousands for ival 1 eq.
&+W* &+LA dense pocket of negative energy&n should no longer be charmable.
