Casting &quot;Bless&quot; on a victim will improve the victim's resistance to spells.

Casting &quot;Bless&quot; on a weapon will make it strike more accurately. You may
need to repeat this if the blessing wears off. It is only possible to 
bless non-evil items, and there is a weight restriction based on the 
proficiency of the caster.
