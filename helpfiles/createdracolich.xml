Area of effect: &lt;corpse&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Animation lasts until undead follower dies (again)
Type of spell:  Summoning

If the Necromancer has a suitable corpse at his feet, &quot;Create Dracolich&quot;
will transform the corpse into a powerful winged dragon. You can order a pet
dracolich to use the following special attacks:

-Roar
-Sweep (tail sweep)
-Breath (breath attack -i.e.: fire breath)

Effectiveness of some of these attacks may be hindered by the dracolich's
ability to maneuver whist in combat, and in the general struggle to obey
your commands they may pause from one instruction to another.
