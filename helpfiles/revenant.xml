<content>
A revenant is an undead being fueled by its desire to return for revenge 
and seeks to wreak terror on those who have wronged it. Few possess the 
strength of will and dedication of vengeance required to first fuel their 
bodies to reanimate and secondly to survive the compact they must make with 
unholy powers to remain on the prime material plane. Those that do find 
themselves bereft of most of the knowledge or memories from their past 
life, but are incessantly driven to cause havoc and exact revenge upon the 
entity that caused them to remain attached to this world. 

Revenants retain more strength and stamina from their bodies because their 
souls reanimate their former corpses, imbuing them with more hardiness than 
most of their undead counterparts. They also possess innate magical 
attributes as a result of their unholy compact with the dark forces, but 
are not equipped to wield more powerful magical energies as a result of 
retaining their mortal flesh. 

Class list:         Warrior, Mercenary 
Statistics:         A revenant seems to take a zombie-like appearance. 
                    Upon further examination the self-awareness and fury
                    inherent in their nature manifests itself. Revenants
                    possess much of the constitution and strength from
                    their former lives as well as an imbued mystical
                    regeneration and they often find themselves as the
                    elite fighters of the undead armies that plague the
                    material plane. 
Innate abilities:   Ultravision, Regeneration, Bodyslam, Shadow Door 
                    Fire vulnerability, Doorbash
