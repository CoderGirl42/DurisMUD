Alchemists are a class that can make things out of seemingly mundane
materials. They have the ability to craft items of all types including body
armor, rings, bracelets, etc. They also have the ability to forge weapons.
In addition to crafting and forging they can mix potions and throw them at
their enemies and at higher levels they are said to be capable of creating
scrolls and the ability to magically enhance items.   

Allowable races: 	Human, Gnome, Goblin, Orc.  		
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, alchemists have their
                        own specific item restrictions. They are restricted
                        in their use of weapons, mainly using maces, clubs
                        and staves. Some exceptions are allowed, however.
                        They can wear almost any type of armor, but are
                        mildly restricted in the use of miscellaneous
                        magical items.
