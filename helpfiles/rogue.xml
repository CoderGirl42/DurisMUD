Rogues utilize the art of concealment and deception to gain an advantage 
over their foes. They are known to be those you'll find hiding in the
shadows, waiting patiently for the perfect time to attack, rather than
jumping into a fight. They are often solitary and tend to spend more time
alone than the other classes.

Allowable races:        Human, Duergar Dwarf, Orc, Drow Elf, Goblin
                        Grey Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome,
                        Half Elf                                          
Equipment usage: 	Rogues have their own classification of item
			restriction.  They can use a number of weapons
			but are more limited in their selection of
			armor.  They are moderately limited in their
			usage of miscellaneous magical items.
