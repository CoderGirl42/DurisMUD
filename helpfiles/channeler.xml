A Channeler is a multi-class Shaman/Conjurer.

Notes on Channeler:
Shamans use totems, and memorize spells without spellbooks.
Conjurers memorize and require spellbooks.
If you start as a Shaman, you will memorize spells, but you will no longer
need totems or spellbooks, for ANY of your spells.
If you start as a Conjurer, you will need spellbooks for all of your
conjurer AND your shaman spells.
