Syntax:         backstab &lt;victim&gt;

A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon in
the victim's back at exactly the point where it will do the most damage. 
The amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency of the
backstabber and the dice on the weapon used.

You may only backstab with piercing weapons. Assassins with good enough
proficiency at dual wielding weapons may double-backstab if they wield two
piercing weapons.
