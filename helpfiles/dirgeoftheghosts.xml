Dirge of the Ghosts allows you to fly around wherever you want, regardless 
of terrain, and helps movement. Flying is not possible in some small caves
or tunnels. The song itself will attempt to fly any players or mobs in a
room that are not flying.

<R>Warning</R>: If your spell expires while you are high in the air or
without any ground beneath you, the fall can hurt or kill you. This 
could result in the possibility of an irretrievable corpse.
