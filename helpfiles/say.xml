Syntax:         say &lt;text&gt; <G>-or-</G> ' &lt;text&gt;
                tell &lt;character&gt; &lt;text&gt;
                whisper &lt;character&gt; &lt;text&gt;
                ask &lt;character&gt; &lt;text&gt;

In order to communicate with other players, you must begin your sentences 
with one of the above commands. Use &quot;Say&quot; if you wish everyone in the room 
to hear you (characters who are asleep are incommunicado, except to gods).  
The single character ' is a shortcut for &quot;Say&quot; and has precisely the same 
syntax. &quot;Tell&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Ask&quot; are used to keep your conversations
private and must be accompanied by the name of the player with whom you wish 
to converse. &quot;Whisper&quot; and &quot;Ask&quot; can only be used if the player you want to 
converse with is the same room. Whereas, &quot;Tell&quot; is used for global 
communication. You can &quot;Tell&quot; anyone who is awake and has the tell toggle
ON, no matter where they are in the MUD.

Toggling &quot;Tell&quot; will effectively allow you to turn off this line of 
communication. However, it will not prevent a God from speaking to you.
