Area of effect: &lt;caster&gt; &amp; &lt;player&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Instantaneous
Type of spell:  Teleportation

&quot;Relocate&quot; creates an artery in the ether barely big enough to accomodate
the caster and flings him all the way to the person he selected as his
target, no matter how far away his target may be.
 
<R>Warning</R>: Sometimes this artery can rupture, depositing the caster 
        someplace completely unexpected (and perhaps very dangerous).
