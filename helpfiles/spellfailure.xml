	<title>"SPELL FAILURE"</title>
	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
A caster who has practiced specific spells for a long period of time
becomes very skilled at casting the spells. He is able to work his magic
without fear of error or incorrectly invoking magic. So, as he gains in
levels, the lower spells become second nature to him. However, when he is
charged with learning new spells of a more complicated nature than he is
used to, he may find it difficult to cast without error. So, casters will
find that they sometimes cannot cast a spell of their highest circle every
time they try. Expect spell failure as you are learning the spells and are
not yet a master of their powers.
