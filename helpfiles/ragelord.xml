As the name implies, Ragelord's have increased their skills when it comes
to the control of their baser instincts to flurry and rage. With the
enhanced ability to channel these skills, they have learnt to automatically
berserk should they become wounded in battles, increasing their chance to
survive the encounter. Due to this intense focus upon themselves and the 
battle, they are able to more easily avoid the more harmful attack affects
of their opponents. They are therefore while still primarily defensive in
nature, able to tune themselves to a more effective offensive captability.
