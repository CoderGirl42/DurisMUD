Calling on the power of storms, Ethermancers utilize the elements of ice 
and wind to smite their foes. Although offensive in nature, Ethermancers 
have the unique ability to dispel powerful magic where others cannot, and
can sometimes even steal it. Their bodies are composed mostly of ethereal
matter which causes them to be resilient to physical attacks, yet more
prone to magical attacks. When walking they leave a trail of frost, 
allowing them to tread where others cannot go.

Allowable races:        Harpy

Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage:        Harpies fall under the Priest classification
                        of item restriction.  This means they are
                        restricted to use of non-edged weapons such as
                        maces, clubs and staves. They can wear almost 
                        any type of armor, but are mildly restricted 
                        in the use of miscellaneous magical items.
