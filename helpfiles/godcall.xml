Syntax:         innate god call

The Cleric has the ability to call upon their God to come to their aid.
Before specialization, this ability will have one of three effects. After
specialization, it will have only one effect.

Zealot:
The zealot will call upon the gods to strengthen him in the ways of combat.
For the duration the cleric will gain melee attacks and also receive a
boost to his hitroll and damroll. 

Holyman:
The blessing of the gods will blanket the room with peace causing all 
players and npc characters to disengage from combat. It will also clear all 
the mobs tracking the cleric.

Healer:
Using the god call as a healer will result in a powerful uninterruptible 
heal that can take form in two different ways. If the god call is used
without a target it will heal every person in the group by 200 hitpoints. 
If it is used with a target it will heal that person 600 hitpoints.
