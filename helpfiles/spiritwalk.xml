Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Spiritual

This spiritual spell allows the caster to cross the boundaries of the
outer planes and seek the lifeforce of the dearly departed. After the
lost soul has been found, a mystical conduit is opened between the
Spiritualist, the soul and the soul's corporeal body, pulling the caster
to the last site of death.  However, if the corporeal body has been
embalmed, or tampered with via other forms of preservation, this spell
has unpredictable results.
