Syntax: &lt;stance none|offensive|defensive&gt;

A player can make use of stances to increase his defensive and offensive 
capabilities when fighting. The offensive stance will raise all skills 
flagged offensive by a set number and all defensive skills will be lowered 
by the same number. The reverse is used when going into the defensive 
stance. Stances are later used when dealing with group formations and will 
then deal other bonuses depending on which formation was chosen. 

If someone other than the group leader, which is defined by the person 
everyone follows, uses a stance while the group is not in formation then 
that person will not be able to follow the group leader.

Something that should be noted when using stances is that it affects the 
skill dodge. A high skill in dodge will make the character harder to bash 
and this value goes up if you are in defensive stances and it goes down if 
you are in offensive stance.
