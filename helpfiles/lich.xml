	<title>LICH</title>
<content>
A Lich exists because of its own desires and the use of powerful and arcane
magic. The Lich passes from a state of humanity to a non-living existence
through both force of will, and from employing nearly forgotten and
forbidden forms of necromancy. In life, Liches were mostly ultra powerful
necromancers or clerics who, out of an intense fear of death, took
advantage of an unholy opportunity to prolong their lives almost
indefinitely by willingly making the transformation from living to undead.
Although Liches can exist for many eons, eventually its life force will
begin to wane, dooming the Lich to spend eternity roaming strange planes
of existence unknown to even the wisest of sages.

Lich class list:     Necromancer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Conjurer, Alchemist,
                     Dreadlord, Unholy-Piper.

Lich stats:	     A Lich can appear as a skeleton at first glance,
                     but they are covered by a very tight layer of dead
                     and pallid skin.  They are often covered with
                     rotting but fine garments.  Their eye sockets are
                     black holes with glowing points of light in the
                     center.

Lich innate abilities: Ultravision
