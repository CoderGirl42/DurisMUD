Howling Screams, whirling whips, snacking on danger and dining on death. 
Berserkers attack in a focused battle rage that can grant them many
advantages on the battlefield. While at the same time their style tends to
be sloppier than that of warriors. Hence they tend to take more damage and
lack some skills with the shield. Many have been known to wield 2 handed
weapons with a fury almost unmatched. Their rage tends to focus themselves
totally on a single target at a time. So while in their younger years they
tend to attack more than warriors. As they age, they finally learn that
sometimes you must switch whom you fight. Bards sing of rumors that some
Berserkers have found a way to increase their size. If these stories are
true or not, it is not truly known. They are said to pray to the ancient
gods of the Nordic Lands. Such names as Odin, Loki, Thor, Beretorn, and
Kvasir. What powers are granted by these beings is a closely guarded
secret. Only the ancient dervish knows the true power that can be
unleashed. He dominates the Raven Realms dealing out death to those that
dare travel where they were never meant to be.

Allowable races:    Orc, Human
Equipment usage:    Like all classes on Duris, Berserkers have their own
                    item restrictions. They can use most heavy armor and
                    Non-slashing weapons but are more limited in using
                    magical items.
