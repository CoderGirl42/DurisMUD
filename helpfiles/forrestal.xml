A Forrestal is a multi-class Ranger/Druid.

Notes on Forrestal:
Rangers use spellbooks, and memorize spells.
Druids commune, which is heavilly based on terrain, for both spells
and commune times.
If you start as a Druid, you will commune all your spells.
If you start as a Ranger, you will memorize all your spells, and you
will need spellbooks for BOTH your druid and your ranger spells.
