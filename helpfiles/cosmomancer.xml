The ultimate and most devastating Ethermancer specializes in the long 
forgotten and near shunned arts of cosmocy, the ability the control the 
planets and satellites themselves. By following this course in 
specialization the ethermancer loses some of his more spiritual powers, 
trading those in for pure offense.
