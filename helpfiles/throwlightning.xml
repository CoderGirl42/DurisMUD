Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Instantaneous
Type of spell:  Generic

&quot;Throw lightning&quot; invokes the forces of nature to make lightning strike the
intended victim. It is therefore only possible to cast this spell when you
are outside and while it is raining (or worse), as the spell causes a
massive bolt of lightning to hurl itself from the rain clouds overhead,
striking the intended victim and causing considerable damage.
