This is a medieval based fantasy mud, if you pick a name that is NOT suited
to a mud of that theme, you will be asked to change it. Common names like
Bob, Tomas, Mike are not acceptable, nor are names of famous fictional
characters such as Conan, Drizzt, Elric etc. Names comprised of compound
words (2 words joined into one) or names that sound like titles
(Darkknight, Swordmaster, Deathbringer, etc.) will also not be accepted.
Obviously stupid names will not be accepted. If you get one by when noone
is available to review you, expect to be forced to change it. Profane names
will result in deletion.
