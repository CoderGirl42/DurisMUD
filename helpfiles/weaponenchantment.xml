Area of effect: &lt;weapon&gt;
Aggressive:     N0
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Permanent
Type of spell:  Enchantment

&quot;weapon enchantment&quot; will enchant non-magical (non-modifying) weapons only. 
Non-modifying weapons are those that do not alter any ability. The only way
 to be certain if a weapon is suitable for enchantment is to fully identify 
it.

The level of enchantment given the weapon is random, depending upon
conditions of the weather, magical energies, skill of the conjurer, and the
blessings of the gods.
