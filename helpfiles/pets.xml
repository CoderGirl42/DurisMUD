&quot;Pets&quot; are creatures who will permanently follow you and your orders unless 
you attack them or rent them off. You can aquire them in several different 
ways depending on what type of character you are. Some classes have the
ability to &quot;summon&quot; pets. Others have the ability to &quot;charm&quot; a mob to make
it a pet via an innate ability or a spell. One type of character can raise
the dead to create pets. Finally, some classes are forced to purchase pets 
in pet shops located throughout the world.

NOTE:     Your pet follow orders from you until you attack it, you rent or 
          it dies.
<R>Warning</R>: Some pets, when left alone, will instantly attack players
        when they enter a room. So, be careful where you leave your pets!
