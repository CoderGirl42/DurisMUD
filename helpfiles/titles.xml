Duris is a fantasy based mud and as such we expect the players to have 
fantasy based titles, if they have them at all. What a proper title is
might be different for most but there are some basics. 

	-Do not use foul language
	-Do not use racial slurs
 	-Keep it in character

Duris may not be a role-play mud but that does not mean we don't work hard 
to try to cultivate a good fantasy feeling while online. Any title that 
breaks this is considered a bad title and may be subject to change. If guild 
ranks are out of line the guild is subject to be disbanded.
