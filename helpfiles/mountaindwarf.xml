	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
Preferring to dwell in fortresses built into huge mountain ranges,
mountain dwarves are a mining race known for their fine craftsmanship of
weapons and armor. They are good-natured, sturdy, fearsome warriors who
possess, due to extremely dense muscle and bone structure, high endurance.
Stronger but clumsier than humans, mountain dwarves tend to live to be 
hundreds of years old and often acquire great wisdom with their age. This 
accumulation of intense wisdom frequently induces many of this race to 
become mentors later in life. Mountain dwarves are born with natural 
infravision, which allows them to maneuver quite skillfully in the dark. 
They are well respected among most of the other races, and often trade 
among the general colonies. Mountain dwarves hold a deep abhorrence for the
races of the Underdark, particularly their evil cousins, the gray dwarves, 
more commonly known as duergar.

Class list:       Warrior, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary.
Statistics:       Dwarves are stronger and hardier than humans, and
                  somewhat more dexterous, but tend to be less intelligent
                  and agile.
Innate abilities: infravision, strength
