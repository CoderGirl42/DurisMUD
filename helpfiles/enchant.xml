<content>
This skill will imbue a piece of equipment of your choosing with any spell
up to a certain power that is currently affecting the casting alchemist.
There are some restrictions in the type of spells that may be enchanted;
Offensive spells or any spells that are of the &quot;self only&quot; cast type cannot
be enchanted into the item. Only one enchant affect can be held on a piece
of equipment at any one time and the effect will wear off in the
appropriate time span. Enchanting an item can be an expensive exercise and
you will need to carry the necessary funds to use this skill. An enchanted
item will display a flag indicating that status if successful, however, 
beware that unsuccessful enchant attempts may actually damage the item in 
the process. Example Syntax: enchant cloak 'vitality'
