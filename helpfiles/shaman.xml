Shamans are unlike most other magic-using classes, in that they use the
powers of nature, the elements and the spirit world to create and use their 
magics. Unlike Druids, however, they twist the forces of nature for their 
own uses instead of communing on a more friendly, integral level. Shamans'
spellcasting abilities include healing and offensive, though neither is as 
far-reaching or potent as those of a Sorcerer or Cleric. Shamans are also 
unique in that they must use totems in order to cast their spells. For more 
help, see TOTEM.

Allowable races:        Ogre, Swamp Troll, Orc, Barbarian, Centaur, Goblin,
                        Gnome, Halfling, Minotaur, Human.
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Shamans fall under the Priest classification of 
                        item restriction. This means they are restricted to 
                        use of non-edged weapons such as maces, clubs and 
                        staves. Some exceptions are allowed, depending on 
                        the deity you worship. They can wear almost any 
                        type of armor, but are mildly restricted in the use 
                        of miscellaneous magical items.
