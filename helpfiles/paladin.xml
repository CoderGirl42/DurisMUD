<content>
Paladins are holy warriors that are dedicated to their gods and to bringing
good to the world. They are hearty fighters that possess limited clerical 
powers granted to them as a reward for their virtue and chivalry. Paladins
are slightly less skilled than pure Warriors and are the best horsemen in 
the world. They have an innate bonus to all saving throws and always detect
evil and good.

Paladins may *not* set &quot;toggle vicious&quot; to on, nor may they set AGGR on, as
this goes against all their training and principles.

Note: Paladins gain <r>less</r> experience from attacking the wrong things!

As follows:
  and Victim is EVIL:             gain full XP as normal.
If Victim is aggressive to either GOOD alignment or Humans:
  and Victim is GOOD or NEUTRAL:  gain less XP from normal.
If Victim is not aggressive to either GOOD alignment or Humans:
  and Victim is GOOD or NEUTRAL:  gain much less XP from normal.

Allowable races:   Human, Half-Elf
Innate abilities:  Lay Hands, Detect Evil, Detect Good, Summon Mount
Equipment usage:   Paladins have their own classification of item
                   restriction.  They can use almost all weapons
                   and most type of armor, but are somewhat limited
                   in their use of miscellaneous magical items.
