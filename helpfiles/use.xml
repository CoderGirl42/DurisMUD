	<title>USE WANDS STAFF STAVES</title>
<content>
Syntax:  use &lt;staff&gt;
         use &lt;wand&gt; &lt;target&gt;

In order to invoke a wand or staff, you must first hold it in your hand, 
then employ the &quot;use&quot; command. Using a staff will automatically target 
everyone and everything in the room except yourself. A wand, on the other
hand, must be pointed at a target in order for you to use it. Because wands
and staves are magical items, they will not be effective if used in a
&quot;No Magic&quot; room.
