Every race has its own language, and some can also speak a smattering of
other languages. Unless you are proficient in a language, the
communications of someone speaking that language will be incomprehensible
or garbled. You gradually learn another language by being in contact with
those who speak it and listening to it for long enough.

There is currently one language for each race, and a private god language.
