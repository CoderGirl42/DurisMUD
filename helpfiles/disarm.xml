Syntax:         disarm &lt;victim&gt; &lt;object&gt;

&quot;Disarm&quot; provides a chance of knocking an opponent's weapon (or other
object) from its hands. The chance of success is exceedingly small when
applied to mobs and larger when used against player characters. If you
successfully disarm your opponent's weapon, it will drop the weapon and
fight in hand-to-hand combat. But, if you fail, you may fumble your own 
weapon.
