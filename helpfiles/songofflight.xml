Flying allows you to fly around wherever you want, regardless of terrain,
and helps movements. Flying is not possible in some small caves or tunnels.
The song itself will attempt to fly any players or mobs in a room that are
not flying.

Warning: If your spell expires while you are high in the air or without any
ground beneath you, the fall can hurt or kill you. This could result in the
possibility of an irretrievable corpse.
