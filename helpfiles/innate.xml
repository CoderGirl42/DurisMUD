Typing &quot;innate&quot;, gives you a list of your race's or classes' innate 
abilities, if any. Innate abilities are those skills or spells which all 
members of your race or class know instinctively. To use an innate ability, 
use the proper syntax for the given skill or spell. To get more information 
on a particular skill or spell, type &quot;help &lt;skill&gt;&quot; or &quot;help &lt;spell&gt;,&quot; 
respectively. The innate abilities for each race or class are listed under 
their help entry.
