Magic is the broad category of phenomena that goes above and beyond normal
mortal powers. This can range from spells with an immensely wide variety
of effects to the uncanny abilities of a particular type of creature to the
curative powers of a potion to the power of song, and even further, into
areas as yet unexplored. Magic permeates the Realms, binding it together,
but few mortals can claim to possess a working knowledge of the Art, let
alone so-called &quot;mastery.&quot;

A list of major topics discussing magic can be found under &quot;help mystics&quot;.
