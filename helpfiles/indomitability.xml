Area of effect: &lt;caster&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Spiritual

Any Spiritualist under the power of &quot;Indomitability&quot; will see beyond
life and death, and thus shed his primal fears. Enchantments designed 
to repel will fall short, and even the roars of the most mighty dragons
will not budge the caster's feet.
