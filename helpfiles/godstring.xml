&quot;String&quot; is for changing the text-strings associated with objects and
characters.

Syntax:  string &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;field&gt; [&lt;string&gt; | &lt;keyword&gt;]

&lt;type&gt; is either &lt;obj&gt; or &lt;char&gt;

&lt;field&gt; is one of the following (the names may be abbreviated):

Name                    (the call-name of an obj/char -e.g., &quot;giant&quot;)
Short                   (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                    (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                   (for players)
Description             (for look-at.  For obj's, must be followed by
                         a keyword)
Delete-description      (only for obj's.  Must be followed by a keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make
you enter a string mode (like a bulletin board), and the game will
prompt you for new lines to the string until you exceed the maximum
length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.
