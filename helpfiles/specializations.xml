Upon reaching level 30, you may &quot;specialize&quot; you character, meaning to 
choose a path or skill-set. After you have decided what specialization you
would like to be, you must find the proper &quot;teacher&quot; mob of your class to
aid you in your specialization. Then, you must type &quot;spec &lt;specname&gt;&quot; to 
confirm your choice.

<R>WARNING</R>: Once you specialize it is very difficult to change your choice!
It requires a specific quest and 50 epics.

NOTE: Not all classes have specializations available.
      Use help &lt;specname&gt; for information on a specific specialization.
