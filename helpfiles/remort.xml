	<title>REMORT ASCEND</title>
	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
The &lt;ascend/remort&gt; command is available to Paladins and Evil Necromancers
once they have gained their 50th level.  They spend 50 epic points to
become a new class (and race for necromancers) at the spec teacher for
their class.

Remort'ed characters retain their pre-remorted character statistics, but
all previous choices the mortal has made are unraveled, allowing them to
choose a new specialization of their liking.

At the necromancer specialist teacher, evils are able to use the &lt;remort&gt; 
command to transform themselves into a Vampire Dreadlord.
At the paladin specialist teacher, goodies are able to use the &lt;ascend&gt; 
command to transform themselves into an Avenger.
