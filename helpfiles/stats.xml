<content>
Duris character abilities are on a bell-curved 1-100 scale. The number 
given to any statistic is a measure of how you rate WITHIN YOUR OWN RACE. A 
Gnome with 100 Strength, for example, is as strong as it is possible for a 
Gnome to be, without major magical enhancement. However, even a moderately 
strong Ogre would be vastly stronger than a 100 strength Gnome. Ogres are 
known for strength, Gnomes are not. The conversion factors for a given race 
are hidden and not available to players. Experimentation will no doubt 
discover some of them, and checking the help on a race will give you an 
idea where their strengths and weaknesses lie. All races of Duris use the 
same scale (1-100) and all races have their own set of conversion factors. 
Do not bother asking a God what these factors are, most won't know.
Furthermore, the ones that do know will not tell you, experiment and find 
out.
