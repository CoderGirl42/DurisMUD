When you die to another player you will be placed in your respective
heaven. Each side of the racewars has their own heaven. The only way to
leave heaven is by resurrection, or by waiting a specific amount of time. 
Depending on how high level you are, that will determine the length of time
your mortal soul binds to a new body. You will only visit your heaven when 
you die to another player. Without the limitations of a body your mind is
more attune to magic and you will be able to memorize any spell you are
able to use.
