<content>
Half-elves are shunned by humans on this world, and, because of this, are
limited in the classes in which they may train. They do have, however, the
option of starting in one of several cities. Half-elves have infravision
and live much longer than humans, although not as long as their full-
blooded grey elf kin.

Classes:    Warrior, Conjurer, Sorcerer, Ranger, Druid, Bard, Assassin,
            Cleric, Paladin, Necromancer, Thief.
Statistics: Half-elves tend to be slightly weaker and frailer than humans,
            but also tend to be slightly quicker and smarter. Also better
            looking.
Innates:    Infravision.
