	<title>GITHYANKI</title>
<content>
Coming from the Astral plane, this race of evil humanoids were slaves of
the Illtihid race millennia ago. The Githyanki broke away from their former 
masters after learning many of their mental powers, and learning how to be 
pure evil.

Githyanki HATE their former masters more then anything and will instantly
attack them on site! Giths will go out of their way to hunt down and
kill any illithid they can find. Githyanki do not have a normal hometown
but must start on the astral plane, in a fortress of Githyanki there. As
newly adult Giths they must now venture to the prime plane and make a
name for themselves.

Githyanki look much like humans only slightly taller, much more thin, with
faces that resemble a decomposing corpse. They tend to be ruthless and
significantly smarter than humans.

Class list:       Warrior, Anti-Paladin, Sorcerer, Necromancer, Bard,
                  Psionicist, Conjurer.       
Innate abilities: levitate, ultravision, shift_prime, shift_astral

<R>Warning</R>:  As one of the eight evil races on Duris, the Githyanki are
extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their hometown
has been specifically designed to make life hell and death waits
around every corner.  Githyanki will most certainly encounter situations
that would be deemed &quot;unfair&quot; to any of the surface races.  We did
this to create a new challenge for those advanced players who have
&quot;beaten&quot; the challenge of life on the surface world and are looking
for something more difficult.  You should NOT play a Githyanki unless you
are a *very* advanced player and are used to the Duris style of
MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without complaint, as it
will NOT be easy.
