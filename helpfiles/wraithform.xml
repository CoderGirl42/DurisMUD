When under the influence of Wraithform a necromancer can walk unseen by
mortal eyes, undetected by any spells. Doors and walls are meaningless to
anyone under the influence of Wraithform as well. After casting the spell, 
anything the caster happens to be wearing or carrying at the time will fall
to the ground.
