	<title>QUEST</title>

General Information.

Currently quests exist on Duris in several different forms.  The first
includes quests that are built into the game.  They may be quests for
information, reward, items, spells, and other various things.  Such
quests have quest mobs in the game.  These are monster who have
information concerning the quest.  In order to obtain the information you
must ask or tell the monster some key word which will trigger a
response.  That response may be followed by more key words, etc.  A
monster or mob may require a specific item which he will reward you for
with information, rewards, or a spell.  The gods on Duris will NOT
reveal information about these mobs.  It is up to you to find them.
The second form of quest is run by the gods themselves.  It is usually a
story that they will tell and groups must be formed to solve it.  The
quests are for FUN.  The sole idea behind doing a quest is NOT a reward.
The gods have taken their own time to create something different and
exciting for the mud.  Be grateful.  Because these quests are run by the
gods, they have the power to do what they desire and that may include
changing the form of the quest.
