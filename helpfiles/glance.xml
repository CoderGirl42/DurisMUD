Syntax: glance [opponent]
        glance &lt;target&gt;

While in battle, it is often advantageous to check the health condition of
your comrades or the mob that you are fighting. Instead of using the &quot;look&quot;
command, which will list all the equipment the player or mob is wearing,
use the &quot;glance&quot; command. This command will provide you with a synopsis of
the current health of the mob or player that you are glancing at. Others
cannot see you glancing.
