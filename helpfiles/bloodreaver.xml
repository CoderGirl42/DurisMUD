<content>
The Blood Reaver has mastered the use of pain and blood bonds using this
to create a number of new abilities. With its attention fully focused on
a victim the reaver will slowly but steadily drain the victim of his life
by presence alone. He may also link with a fellow group member to drain
or give life depending on how is hurt. It is a two-way bond.
