Sorcerers are spellcasters who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of
great and powerful magic. The spells at their command are primarily
offensive and are not granted through the worship of any deity. Sorcerers
are physically weak by most standards, and can be quite frail. Their
abilities at hand-to-hand combat leave much to be desired, and, in most
cases, they leave the fighting arts to Fighters. To make up for these
handicaps, Sorcerers have created some of the deadliest spells in the
world, many of which can kill with a single blow.

Allowable races:        Human, Grey Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Goblin,
                        Half-Elf, Orc, Githyanki, Drow Elf, Lich, Vampire,
                        Shade, Harpy, Gargoyle

Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage: 	Sorcerers have their own classification of item 
                        restriction. This means they have the smallest range 
                        of weapons that they can wield and a very small 
                        range of armor to choose from. They have almost no 
                        restrictions on what miscellaneous magical items 
                        they can use.
