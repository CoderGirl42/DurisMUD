Syntax:         sneak (for Assassin, Unholy-Piper, Bard)
                sneak off

This allows you to move silently from one place to another. A person who 
sneaks successfully will be able to travel (for a period of time) without 
anyone taking notice of his or her arrival or departure. As with most 
learned skills, there is always a chance that you will not sneak 
successfully and, with this particular command, you will be unable to tell 
if it has worked or not. You can quit sneaking with &quot;sneak off.&quot;
