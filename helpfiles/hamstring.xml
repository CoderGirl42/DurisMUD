Syntax:         Hamstring &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes

A very very high level rogue can hamstring his victims. He slices at his
victim's hamstrings, greatly impairing their ability to run away. If the
rogue successfully hamstrings his victim, the rogue can much more easily
stab the poor guy to death.
