Syntax:         petition &lt;text&gt;
      
The &quot;Petition&quot; command allows you to send a message to all of the Gods 
currently on the MUD (if there are any).  Certain guidelines should be
followed when petitioning:

* Players (and Gods) are <R>NOT</R> to use petition as their own personal
  chat channel.

* Do <R>NOT</R> use petition for reporting ideas, suggestions, or complaints.

* Do <R>NOT</R> use petition to inquire if a God is logged on. If the God
  does not appear on the &quot;who&quot; list, assume he/she is not on.

* If you have a problem, please describe it in details right away. 
  Do not force Gods to respond to any form of &quot;anyone there&quot; type spam.

Remember that the Gods abide by a non-interference policy. Petition should
not be used to ask questions about equipment, areas, mobs or general game 
play.

If you have a question or need help with a problem, you can either ask 
another player, post on the Duris forums or petition. To speak privately
with a God, use the &quot;Tell&quot; command. Or, if you discover a bug or typo on
Duris, use the &quot;Bug&quot; or &quot;Typo&quot; command. To submit your ideas, you may
implement the &quot;Idea&quot; command. Lastly, if you feel you just HAVE to whine,
use your guild board (if you have access to one) or use the Duris Forums.

Abuse of the petition channel will only invoke the wrath of the gods. We
expect EVERYONE to abide by this.
