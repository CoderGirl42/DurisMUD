Area of effect: &lt;corpse&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Animation lasts until undead follower dies (again)
Type of spell:  Summoning

If the Necromancer has a suitable corpse at his feet, &quot;Raise Lich&quot;
re-animates the corpse with the formidable power of a Lich. Liches by 
nature are powerful Sorcerers, but their undead prowess allows them to 
cause considerable damage with their bare hands as well.
