The astounding vocal range of a Disharmonist has given them the ability to
utilize their very voice as a weapon against their foe. The terrible 
shriek of the Disharmonist causes disturbing damage to the enemy despite
taking a toll on their throat, forcing them to rest for a period of time
before they can again strain their range to such a high limit.
