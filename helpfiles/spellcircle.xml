Just as in AD&amp;D, Duris has placed its spells in various levels called
circles. As a caster gains in level, he learns more of the magical arts and
has a larger repertoire of spells to choose fro . These new spells exist in
&quot;Circles&quot;. At any given level, a caster can draw from a specified number of
circles and can memorize/pray/tupor/assimilate/commune for a certain number 
of spells in each circle which fit into &quot;Spell Slots&quot;. As a caster's level 
increases he learns more magic and can draw from more circles as well as 
regenerate more spells from each circle. The circles are gained as follows:

        Level 1 -1st Circle
        Level 6 -2nd Circle
        Level 11 -3rd Circle
        Level 16 -4th Circle
        Level 21 -5th Circle
        Level 26 -6th Circle
        Level 31 -7th Circle
        Level 36 -8th Circle
        Level 41 -9th Circle
        Level 46 -10th Circle
        Level 51 -11th Circle
        Level 56 -12th Circle

See the specific help files on each class to find out which spells belong
to each circle for any given class. There is a slight chance of spell
failure for the last circle learned.
