Syntax:     frag 
            frag &lt;classname&gt;
            frag &lt;racename&gt;
            frag &lt;racewarsidename&gt;

The term &quot;frag&quot;, originally taken from the Vietnam War, is when you kill 
another player. Every time you kill someone who is an opposite racewar side,
(a Human killing a Drow, etc), you get a frag. Every time you are killed by 
someone who is an opposite racewar side, (a Phantom being killed by a 
Drow), you lose a frag. All frags are split between the group equally. So,
if you are with a group of five people and you kill one player, you will
each receive .20 frags. For each player killed, there is a total of 1.00
frags to be split among the grouped victors. Typing &quot;fraglist&quot;  will show
a list of the top ten and lowest ten fraggers in the mud. Or, you may type
&quot;frag &lt;racewarside&gt;&quot;, &quot;frag &lt;classname&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;frag racename&gt;&quot;.
