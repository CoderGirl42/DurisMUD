Syntax:        teach &lt;charname&gt; &lt;spellname&gt;

The teach command allows you to pass on your spell knowledge to others, 
teaching them the spells you know that, that they newly have the ability to 
master. You in effect become their teacher, allowing another to learn from
you instead of traveling back to their guild masters to study and 
practice.
