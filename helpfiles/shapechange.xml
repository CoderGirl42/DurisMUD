Syntax:         To shapechange:              shapechange &lt;target&gt;
                To return to normal:         shapechange me

Druids use this innate ability to change their form. Through careful 
research, the Druid is capable of reforming its body into almost any animal.  

To change into an animal, the druid finds a suitable animal, and while
standing alongside it, types &quot;shapechange animal&quot; (replacing animal with 
the name of the animal.)  While in this form, the druid will notice that it
takes considerably longer to commune spells.  As well, if the druid becomes
engaged in battle while shape changed, they may revert into their original
form.

Changing back:
Type &quot;shape me&quot; to change back into your original form.
