Range weapons fall in two categories:

<c>Fire weapon (bow, crossbow, etc)</c>
To fire a weapon you must be wielding a firing weapon (bow, crossbow, etc) 
and have a quiver with ammunition. You must possess the correct type of 
missile for your particular weapon in order to be able to fire. The number 
of missiles fired depend on the weapon. Elves tend to be very good with 
range weapons.

Syntax:    fire &lt;missile&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;direction&gt;

<c>Thrown weapon (dagger, spear, axe, etc)</c>
To throw a weapon you need to wield it and it must be a throwable weapon. 
If you wield two weapons with the same name, you will throw both. The number 
of attacks is almost the same as when you fight hand-to-hand.

Syntax:    throw &lt;weapon&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;direction&gt;
