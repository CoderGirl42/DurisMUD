&quot;Song of chaos&quot; is sung in a very chaotic fashion, causing those not in
the bard's group to become confused and distracted. This can cause a
number of things to happen, such as forcing those not in the bard's group
out of the room in various ways. A small amount of damage is also bestowed
upon those not grouped.
