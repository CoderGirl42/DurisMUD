Syntax:         practice (t  see a list of spells that may be scribed)
                practice &lt;spell&gt; (while holding both a spellbook and quill
                                  and resting)
		practice all (this will scribe all spells into the book
			      currently held by the player if there is 
			      enough room left)

Practice is a method of scribing your spells. This is done with the help
of a teacher in the room. For this to be done, you must have a spellbook
and quill in hand and resting comfortably. You can then 'practice &lt;spell&gt;'
to add a spell to your spellbook. If this command is typed without any 
parameters and you are in the presence of a teacher it will show your list
of spells.  

In the past, the practice command was also used to increase your skills.
This is no longer the case on Duris, and you must use your skills in battle
to improve them or by gaining levels.
