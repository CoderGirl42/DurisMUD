	<title>BRIGAND</title>
<content>
The Brigand takes advantage of holes in the defense of the enemy, which 
can occur casting or clambering to their feet. He use these moments to deal 
crippling attacks to different parts of the body. And, with some luck, he 
may hit the victim's larynx, causing spell casters to abort. Or, stomp  the
victim's knees so that they have trouble running away.
