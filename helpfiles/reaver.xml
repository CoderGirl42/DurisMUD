Reavers are a unique mix of both warrior and spell-caster. They have left
behind their sorcerous professions, and have instead turned to the powers
of the old gods, studying their ways and natures. As such, they have
forgotten much of their old spells in preference of their new direction, 
however they still retain some core spells from their forgotten pasts. In
their thirst for further power, they also too have looked at the ways of
warriors to enhance their abilities and have training their bodies and
minds to gain physical battle skills to enhance their offensive capacity.

Allowable races:        Drow, Orc, Goblin.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Reavers have their own
                        specific item restrictions. They do however have 
                        quite a wide range of equipment options being able
                        to utilize to some extent, both the weaponry and
                        armor of warriors along with the magical garb of
                        a spellcaster.
