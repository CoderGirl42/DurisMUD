Syntax:         throw &lt;weapon&gt; &lt;target&gt; &lt;direction&gt;

In order to throw a weapon, you must be wielding it and it must be a 
throwable type weapon. If you wield two weapons with the same name, you will 
throw both. The number of attacks is almost the same as when you fight 
hand-to-hand.
