Syntax:        get &lt;object&gt; | take &lt;object&gt;

If you are in a hurry, or if you feel greedy, you can type get all. You can 
also use &quot;get&quot; and &quot;take&quot; to extract objects from containers.

Example:  &quot;get dagger from bag&quot; or more simply, &quot;get dagger bag&quot;.

When there is more than one object of the same name in the container or room 
and you wish to get a particular one, use the following example as a 
guideline:

You are in a room and you see:

        A shiny box is lying in the dirt here.
        A shiny box is lying in the dirt here.

If you wished to get the second box, you would type:

        &quot;get 2.box&quot;
