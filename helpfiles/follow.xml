Syntax:  follow &lt;character&gt;
         toggle follow

If two or more players decide to travel in the same direction, why not
have one of them lead and the rest follow?

For example:

Fizzwig and Manwich decide to go to visit the Sorcerers Guild. Fizzwig 
follows Manwich by typing:

        'follow manwich'

Manwich then leads the way and Fizzwig just sits back and enjoys the 
scenery. Once Fizzwig gets tired of following Manwich around, she can just 
type:

        follow me
           -OR-
        follow self
           -OR-
        follow fizzwig
