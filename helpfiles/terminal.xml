Syntax:  toggle terminal

This toggle lets you select if you want ANSI mode, which shows all the
nifty colors and ANSI art we've added to the mud descriptions, objects
and player lists.  Of course, your communications program must support
this mode in order for it to work properly.  GEN mode is plain old
black-and-white.
