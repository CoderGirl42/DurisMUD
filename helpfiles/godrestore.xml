<content>
When used on a mortal, &quot;restore&quot; restores their hit points, mana, and
movement points to full.

When used on an immortal, &quot;restore&quot; also resets various fields to
their proper values.

Immortals should take cautionary measures if they decide to restore a
player, as this is normally frowned upon.

Syntax:  restore &lt;character&gt;
