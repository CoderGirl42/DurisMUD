Syntax: &lt;group formation&gt;
	&lt;group formation _choice_&gt;

When a group is formed the members of it can decide to use formations to 
enhance the offensive and defensive powers of the group. For every group 
size there is at least one type of group formation. To see which formations 
are available to the group type &lt;group formation&gt;. This will list the 
formations and also display how many people are needed to form it and also 
which stances the group members have to be in for the formation to work. 
If a formation is chosen and the party members are not in the right 
stances they will not be able to follow. The only exception to this rule 
is if the stance is &lt;none&gt;.
