Syntax: sweeping thrust &lt;victim&gt;

In the heat of battle the Warrior will swing low and hard in their attack,
sweeping their weapon at the legs of their opponent. A successful sweeping
thrust will do enough damage to the legs of the victim to knock them from
their feet, causing them lose some of the movement.
