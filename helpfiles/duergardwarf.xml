	<title>"DUERGAR DWARF"</title>
<content>
The duergar are an evil race of gray dwarves that live deep under the
surface of the world, within the depths of the Underdark.  Extremely
cunning and wicked creatures, duergar are known for their deceit and
evil ways.  They hate all other races, except for the drow, with whom
they have grudging trade relations.  They are mortal enemies of the
mountain dwarves.

Duergar are inordinately sturdy and strong, and have permanent
ultravision.  Like the drow, duergar are hurt by natural daylight and
fire, and therefore travel to the surface rarely.

Duergar class list:  Warrior, Cleric, Thief, Assassin, Mercenary.

Duergar stats:  Duergar are stronger and hardier than humans, and somewhat
                more dexterous, but tend to be less intelligent and agile.

Duergar innate abilities:  invisibility, strength, ultravision, UD-sneak,
			   enlarge, hide

<R>Warning</R>:  As one of the eight evil races on Duris, the duergar
are extremely difficult to play and face many hardships.  Their
hometown has been specifically designed to make life hell, and death
waits around every corner.  Duergar will most certainly encounter
situations that would be deemed &quot;unfair&quot; to any of the surface races.
We did this to create a new challenge for those advanced players who
have &quot;beaten&quot; the challenge of life on the surface world and are
looking for something more difficult.  You should NOT play a duergar
unless you are a *very* advanced player and are used to the Duris
style of MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without
complaint, as it is NOT easy.
