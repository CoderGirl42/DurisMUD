Syntax:         bash &lt;victim&gt;

To bash someone is to attempt to knock that person over. If you succeed,
you will inflict minor damage and cause the victim to fall down. Both you
and the victim will then be unable to respond to any commands for a short
duration. If you fail to bash successfully, you will lose your balance and
fall. It is more difficult to bash someone who is sitting/resting already,
although you can inflict greater damage. It is much easier to bash someone
if you are using a shield. Some creatures may be unbashable due to size or
other considerations.

NOTE: Bash will not work in places where there is no footing.
