Just like in real life, in the game you cannot just &quot;quit&quot; life. Your
character must find a safe place such as an Inn or setup camp for the night. 
There are two commands your character can therefore use to leave the game -
rent (at an Inn only) and camp. If you simply close your client and leave 
your character &quot;link dead&quot;, it will remain in the game, which is obviously 
very dangerous, as it will then leave your character defenseless from 
attack.
