The eyeless Dreadlords have senses eerily attuned to other than what can be
seen. This gives them the ability to circle around opponents in the heat of
battle, flanking them and attacking from unexpected positions, making it
harder to dodge and parry their vicious attacks and allowing them to cause
even more damage.
