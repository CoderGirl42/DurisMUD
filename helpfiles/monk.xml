Monks are practitioners of ancient martial arts which allows them to be
lethal adversaries without the benefit of cumbersome weaponry. Their hands
and feet are deadly weapons in themselves, and monks are trained to use 
their body in harmony with their minds to destroy their enemies. Monks are 
required to be strong and nimble of body as well as very quick witted to 
successfully practice their art. In addition to being formidable opponents 
in hand-to-hand combat, monks have also mastered the ability to use certain
specialized &quot;chants&quot; in and out of battle. Their chants further enhance the 
monk's abilities in and out of battle.

Allowable races:        Human.
Equipment usage:        Monks fall under a unique set of restrictions for
                        equipment. Since monks rely on using their bodies
                        as their weapons, they cannot afford to have any 
                        part of them weighted down by cumbersome armor or 
                        clothing. Therefore anything worn by monks must
                        weigh 1 pound or less.  However, higher level Monks 
                        can wear slightly heavier garments. Monks usually 
                        favor very light warrior equipment to assist them 
                        in combat.
