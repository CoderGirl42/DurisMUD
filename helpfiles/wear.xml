Syntax:  wear &lt;object&gt;
         wear all

&quot;Wear&quot; will allow you to try on some of the armor or items you have
obtained during your travels. If you are carrying more than one item of the
same time, and you want to exchange them, use the following syntax:

        remove &lt;item&gt;           (you now hold two of this item)
        wear 2.&lt;item&gt;

The last item you remove or pick up always appears at the top of your
inventory pile.
