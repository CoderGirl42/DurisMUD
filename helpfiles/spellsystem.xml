Duris, in its attempt to improve on the standard, stock DikuMUDs that 
already exist throughout the Internet, has moved away from the traditional 
mana system. In its place, the Duris Forgers have implemented a system very 
similar to that used in the AD&amp;D game. Rather than a pool of mana from 
which any spell can be drawn, casters on Duris must memorize/pray/commune/
assimilate or tupor spells. These spells are divided into different &quot;Spell
Circles&quot; limiting the spells that a caster/semi-caster can draw upon. At 
level 1, a caster is proficient in one spell circle and is allotted one 
&quot;Spell Slot&quot; from that circle which he can regain via one of the methods 
listed above. As he gains in levels, the numbers of slots available in each 
circle increases as does the number of circles in which the caster is 
proficient. The caster has available to him a number of spells at each 
circle which he can regenerate. He simply chooses those spells which he 
wishes to use then must fill his reservoir in one of the mentioned ways. 
The slots can be used up on all different spells or all on the same spell or 
any combination of spells. These spells are then a part of the caster's mind 
and can be called upon at any time. Once a spell is cast it  s no longer 
memorized or prayed for. It becomes a spell that needs to be memorized again. 
It cannot be cast again until it is re-memorized or re-prayed for.
