Syntax:         gsay &lt;message&gt;

This is a &quot;conference&quot; mode of communication used by grouped players. Only 
the members of your group will hear your communication and it also works 
when group members are not in the same room.

Example:
   gsay Let's kill this wraith.

Note: Gsay may possibly be eavesdropped on by classes with the skill 
      &quot;listen&quot;.
