Syntax: examine &lt;object&gt; | &lt;victim&gt;

Long hours and intense study of the equipment and races within the realms
has given the Minstrel a much higher ability to understand and ascertain
the origins and makings of a things and people. This ability has risen to
the levels of the mystical 'identify' spell of the conjurer.

Legend Lore success is dependant upon skill proficiency and may require
several examinations before proper identification and analysis is made.
