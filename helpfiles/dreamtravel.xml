The spell dream travel is a VERY powerful teleportation type spell. Casting
this spell on a player causes the caster to fall asleep and dream of his 
destination and when the caster wakes up he has arrived in most cases at
whom he dreamed of. If the caster casts this spell on themselves every
one in their group not in combat that has consented the caster will 
fall into a deep sleep causing them to dream of the caster and after 
wakening they will be in the same room as the caster.

syntax: cast 'dream travel' playername -to travel to any player on your
        side of the race wars.

	cast 'dream travel' self or me -to cause all consented group
        members to travel to your location.
