Syntax:  ptell &lt;player&gt; &lt;text&gt;

This is exactly like tell, except that &lt;text&gt; is broadcast to all gods
with petition toggled on, to let them know that you responded to a
particular petition.

Example:
        Oinkoink petitions 'Why is the sky blue?'

You reply:
        ptell oinkoink shut the hell up before I term you!

Which displays to the gods as:
        Petition: &lt;your_name&gt; responds to Oinkoink's petition with
        'shut the hell up before I term you!'
