Syntax:         rescue &lt;victim&gt;

As a general rule in a group, the person who takes the first hit will
receive most or all of the damage from the opponent. Often, this person
will become low on hit points and will need to be rescued. To rescue
someone is to attempt to take the place of that person and have the monster
hit you instead. You can only &quot;turn&quot; one monster for each attempt.
