The majority of the Duris world is made up of different areas commonly
called &quot;zones&quot;. Within these zones, a variety of things can be found, they
are filled with mobs, equipment and numerous other things. A set theme 
normally follows within each zone, created by the zone builder, and there 
several different level ranges a zone is intended for. Before exploring, it
