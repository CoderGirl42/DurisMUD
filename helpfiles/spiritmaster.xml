A Spiritmaster is a multi-class Shaman/Cleric.

Notes on Spiritmaster:
Shamans use totems, and memorize spells without spellbooks.
Clerics pray, and require no spellbooks or totems.
If you start as a Shaman, you will memorize spells, but you will no longer
need totems, for ANY of your spells.
If you start as a Cleric, you will pray spells, but again, you will not
need totems, for ANY of your spells.
