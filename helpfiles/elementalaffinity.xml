The Elementalists of Duris have discovered how to attune their physical 
bodies to the rigors which elemental forces can inflict. After suffering an 
elemental onslaught, the caster's body will take on the properties of the 
type of attack that was used, and therefore suffer less from subsequent
attacks of the same nature.
