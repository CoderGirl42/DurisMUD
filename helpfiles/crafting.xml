	<title>CRAFTING</title>
<content>
Crafting is one of the primary skills of the Alchemist Class. By collecting
material pieces	from the corpses of dead mobs an alchemist can craft a wide 
range of equipment that can be used or sold at shops. 

Crafting explained:

With 1 material piece you can create small things like rings, earrings, etc.
With 2 material pieces you can create medium sized things like leggings,
       arm-plates, etc
With 3 material pieces you can create large items like cloaks and body
       armor.

Now you have your materials now what do you do? Select the materials you
want to use place them into your inventory and type:

     craft material object-type.
     
For example, if you have &quot;a cracked magical gold piece&quot; in your inventory
and type &quot;craft gold ring&quot; you may end up with a ring called &quot;a crude
unique gold ring&quot;. 

Identifying the item after it is created will show you the stats. The
quality of the material used, your skill in crafting and your current level
all play a part in how powerful your newly crafted equipment becomes. We
are not giving out material formulas as it is a closely guarded alchemist
secret and nobody wants a guild of alchemists on their back.
