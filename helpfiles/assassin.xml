<content>
Assassins are practitioners of death and stealth, always lurking down dark
alleys and just around the corner, ready to commit a convenient act of
murder if it suits them. Assassins are adept at the art of concealment and
deception, but they are not as skilled at the art of stealth as other
related classes might be. Assassins are by far the most deadly creatures
around if they catch you by surprise and happen to be carrying their
favorite daggers with them.
