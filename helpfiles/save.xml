Syntax:         save

The &quot;Save&quot; command allows you to save the current state of your character.
This includes experience points, statistics, money and equipment. If the 
game crashes, it resets your character to the statistics and equipment it 
had the last time you saved. It is a good idea to manually save your 
character often, especially if you have recently leveled, potioned or 
fragged. Your character is autosaved periodically by the MUD itself, but 
this is a timed event and may not pick up your more recent changes.
