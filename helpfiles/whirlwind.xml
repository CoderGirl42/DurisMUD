Syntax:         whirlwind

&quot;Whirlwind&quot; causes the Blademaster to suddenly speed up for a duration of
time. During this period, they will have the chance to attack their 
opponent on more occasions than normal. Although, this sudden activity will
wear down the Blademaster, tiring him and costing him movement points.
