This command gives you your Guild Message Of The Day, otherwise known as
the news flashes for your guild that you see when you log in.

Setting up your GMOTD: Only guild leaders are able to change and set your
guild's GMOTD. To do this the leader writes the motd onto a piece of paper
(which can be minor c'ed) and then type 'gmotd paper' to activate it. If
you just type 'gmotd' or you are not a leader, it will show your current
guild motd.
