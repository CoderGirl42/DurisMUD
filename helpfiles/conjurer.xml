Conjurers are the creative branch of the magic-users. They specialize in
enchantments, conjuring creatures and objects. They  re the only ones able
to identify objects. Conjurers, like other magic-users, possess awesome
spell casting might and are able to throw some of the world's most potent
spells. The conjuring style of magic first developed among the mixed breed
races, which would account for their smaller spell list and greater overall
spell potency.

Allowable races:        Human, Gnome, Grey Elf, Drow Elf, Orc, Goblin,
			Githyanki, Lich, Half Elf, Phantom, Shade.
Equipment usage:  	As all classes on Duris, Conjurers have their own
                        classification of item restriction. They have a
                        very small range of weapons they can use and a
                        small range of armor to choose from. They have very
                        little restrictions on what miscellaneous magical
                        items they can use, though.
