	<title>EPIC</title>
<content>
Once a character reaches level 50, they can begin to accumulate Epic Points. 
You can gain these points from either finding and touching the may 
runestones and monoliths hidden about the lands, or by tasting the blood of 
your enemies. The epic points will accumulate, and once you reach a certain 
amount you will gain a skill point. Skill points can be used for several 
things in the realms, most notably the advancement of epic skills. The epic 
skills list as follows:

<W>Anatomy
</W><W>Advanced Meditation
</W><W>Summon Blizzard
</W><W>Chant Mastery
</W><W>Summon Familiar
</W><W>Hone Weapon</W>

It is also rumored that 50 Epic Points are required to venture into the 
realm of multiclassing, and that skill points have the capability to reset 
one's chosen path.
