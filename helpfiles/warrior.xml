	<title>WARRIOR</title>
	<category type="Sub-Class of: Fighter"/>
<content>
Warriors have more strength than the average player, and this makes them
better at hand-to-hand combat. They possess skills of fighting that are
unequaled by members of any other class. Because they employ such finesse
in their fighting tactics, Warriors have been thought to resemble
swashbucklers or fencers when at their best. They are, in essence, the
ultimate fighter and are the best in the world at skills such as bash, 
rescue, kick, and parry. The advantages of being a warrior lie within
these skills.

Allowable races:        Human, Barbarian, Drow Elf, Grey Elf, 
                        Mountain Dwarf, Duergar Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, 
                        Ogre, Swamp Troll, Orc, Half-Elf, Goblin, Vampire, 
                        Wight, Githyanki, Centaur, Storm Giant, Thri-Kreen,
                        Minotaur, Shade, Revenant, Death Knight,
                        Shadow Beast.
Innate Abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Warriors have their own 
                        item restrictions. They can use most heavy armor 
                        and weapons but are more limited in using magical 
                        items.
