Chanting is a talent developed by monks used to further enhance their
martial arts skills. There are a number of different chants available to
monks, all varying in power and purpose.

Heroism -Heroism elevates the amount of adrenaline produced by the chanter 
and stimulates the centers of the mind controlling dexterity and balance, 
resulting in increased combat abilities. For the follower of the 'Way of
the Snake' this rush of adrenaline also increases speed and movement while
the Dragon Disciples become immune to fear.

Calm -Calm soothes whoever or whatever might be angry at the chanter or 
his friends. This chant has the capability of ceasing combat in certain 
situations.

Quivering Palm -This chant causes the chanter's hand to vibrate so fast it 
can barely be seen. The hand then strikes out at equally fast speeds, 
inflicting formidable damage upon its target.

Cell Adjustment -The chant allows the monk to rearrange the cellular
makeup of his body to his own liking. This comes in handy when afflicted 
with various maladies.

Regenerate -When chanting Regenerate, the monk heals at a much faster
rate.

Buddha Palm -Buddha Palm, much like Quivering Palm, causes the monk's
hands to vibrate at unbelievable speeds. However, the Buddha Palm strikes
out with both hands at lightning speed at as many adversaries as it can.
