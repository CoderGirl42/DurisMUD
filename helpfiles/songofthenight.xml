Type of song:	Generic

&quot;Song of the Night&quot; is sung in a very chaotic fashion, causing those not in
the piper's group to become confused and distracted. This can cause a
number of things to happen, such as forcing those not in the bard's group
out of the room in various ways either by fleeing or random teleportation.
A small amount of damage is also bestowed upon those not grouped.
