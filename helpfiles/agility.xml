Agility is a measure of how coordinated you are overall; how well you
handle movements of your whole body. It is the primary attribute of Rogue
and Fighter type classes. For Thieves, it will enable them to have better 
chances with skills such as &quot;Trip&quot;. For Fighters and Rogues, it will 
increase the rate at which they &quot;Dodge&quot; and &quot;Parry&quot; attacks.
