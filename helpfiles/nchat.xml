Syntax:        nchat hi there

This is a communications channel for new players to the game to talk to
others on their own racewar side at lower levels. It can also be used as a
means to gain information and help in regard to the game. 

This channel will remain open to you only until you reach a certain level.
However there will be a set of higher level, more experienced players
within the game that have special access to this channel who will provide 
assistance and help where they are able.
