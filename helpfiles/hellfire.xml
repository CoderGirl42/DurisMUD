&quot;Hellfire&quot; opens a channel from the bowels of hell unto the antipaladin
himself. Imbued with the power of pure hellborne fire, the antipaladin not
only has a more acute vampiric touch, but his touch extends through to the
tip of his weapon. In other words, he can vamp while wielding and the vamp 
is based only on the dice of that weapon.
