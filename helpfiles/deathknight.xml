	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
The Death Knight is a twisted form of a Lich. A race of undead warriors
spawned by a demon prince (popular thought credits Demogorgon), from fallen
human paladins. No one knows exactly why this was done except for the
obvious explanation: The raising of an army that was never used. The
perverted soul of the former paladin lives through eternal torment in its
undead state, killing anything that will satisfy its rage at what has been
done to it.

Allowable races:       Anti-paladin, Warrior, Mercenary.

Death knight stats:    Unlike Liches, Death Knights wear heavy armor and 
                       the weapons of warriors. They will usually be riding
                       a nightmare which they often summon to do their
                       bidding.

Innate abilities: Ultravision, summon mount, anti-good, vampiric touch,
                  fireball, fireshield, firestorm, protection from fire
