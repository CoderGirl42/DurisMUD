Syntax:         feign death

&quot;Feign Death&quot; is a rather clever way of fooling all those nearby into 
believing that you have died. In actuality, you are alive a d in hiding. 
You then have a good chance of escaping in one piece since only the most 
astute of enemies can determine that you are still alive.
