<content>
Ogres are a race of massive humanoids that are typically three feet taller
and twice as strong as average humans. Although they are extremely
unintelligent and clumsy, ogres are fearsome warriors and are feared by all
races. Ogres are evil and ill-tempered creatures, and they tend to be
excessively destructive and have been known to occasionally eat humans.
They live amongst themselves in clan-fashion and often organize war parties
to raid and pillage.  

Class list:        Warrior, Shaman.
Stats:             Big as house, strong as ox, ugly as sin, not quick, oh
                   and did I mention some rocks are smarter? Ogre shamans
                   have a rough time.
Innate Abilities:  doorbash, ultravision, bodyslam, bearhug, ogreroar

<R>Warning</R>: As one of the eight evil races on Duris, ogres are extremely
difficult to play and face many hardships. Their hometown has been
specifically designed to make life hell, and death waits around every
corner. Ogres will most certainly encounter situations that would be deemed
&quot;unfair&quot; to any of the surface races. We did this to create a new challenge
for those advanced players who have &quot;beaten&quot; the challenge of life on the
surface world, and are looking for something more difficult. You should NOT
play an ogre unless you are a *very* advanced player and are used to the
Duris style of MUDding, or are willing to face the hardships without
complaint, as it is NOT easy.
