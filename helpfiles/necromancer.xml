<content>
Necromancers are the branch of magic-users devoted to spells dealing with
the dead and undead. The spells available to a Necromancer are primarily
offensive in nature and are not granted by a deity. In fact, many of a
Necromancer's spells are viewed as evil by the gods. However, the
Necromancer's dark art can transcend the boundary between life and death,
and harness the energies of those on both sides.

Allowable races:        Human, Half-Elf, Drow, Orc, Goblin, Githyanki,
                        Lich, Vampire
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Necromancers have their own classification of item
			restriction. They have a small range of weapons
			that they can wield and a smaller range of armor to
			choose from. They can, however, use most magical
			items.
