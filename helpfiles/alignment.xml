Your character's alignment (GOOD, NEUTRAL or EVIL) will govern how he or
she reacts to other players and/or monsters. The following is an outline of 
the alignment system:

<W>GOOD (350 to 1000)</W> is the most prone to change (i.e., the hardest to
maintain). Killing other good-aligned players and monsters will harm it the
most, but killing neutrals can shift it towards evil as well.

<G>NEUTRAL (-349 to 349)</G> is affected most by killing non-extreme
alignments (i.e., other neutrals). Killing extremes such as 1000 and -1000
is just maintaining the balance, and will have no effect on your alignment.

<R>EVIL (-350 to -1000)</R> is the most difficult to change. Almost anything
an evil person kills can be considered (at best) a neutral act, but it is
most likely the kill will just serve to make the person more evil. Only by
killing things more evil than oneself can one creep up out of the pit.

Alignment ranges from -1000 to 1000. Due to the way alignment works, before 
long your alignment will actually reflect your playing style, and will not 
fluctuate much unless you change your playing style drastically.
