Syntax:         mount &lt;mountname&gt;

                dismount

Duris now has mounts available for renting or direct buyer purchase, as
well as Paladin's and Anti-Paladin's summoned mounts. You can only ride
your own steed and cannot ride into a single file room or indoors. You must
dismount and have your steed follow you.

There is also the ability for those on the side of good to be able to mount
and ride their Centaur friends, though the rider must have consent, and the
Centaur must be wearing a saddle. Be careful! if the Centaur becomes tired
of their rider, they may attempt to buck them from the saddle.

Syntax:          buck
