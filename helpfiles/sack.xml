Sacking is conquering a guildhall and claiming as your own. To sack a
guildhall, you must get passed the golems by killing them. You must remain
in the hall, alive, for one week game time. If you die, or leave the hall
at any time, your sack with be nullified. 

Once a guildhall has been sacked, all golems and teleporter objects will
be removed or inactive. The new owning guild may then start building new
golems and other items.

You must be 25th level minimum to sack a guildhall.
