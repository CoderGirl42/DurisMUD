Syntax:         toggle vicious

When this option is ON, you will kill the mortally wounded during battle. 
When this toggle is OFF, you will disengage from battle when whoever or 
whatever you are fighting is incapacitated.

NOTE: Paladins do not have the option of turning &quot;Vicious&quot; ON, as it is
      against their moral training.
