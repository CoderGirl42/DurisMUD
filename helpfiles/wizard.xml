	<title>WIZARD</title>
<content>
An advanced spellcaster in the ways of the Sorcerer, the Wizard can 
manipulate the essences of magics as they are tossed through the very air.
Many times they are able to disperse and dispel offensive magics aimed at 
them and sometimes even take the energies and throw the spell back from 
whence it came. The Wizard always has their spellbook close at hand and has 
imbued it with their name, they need only summon it.
