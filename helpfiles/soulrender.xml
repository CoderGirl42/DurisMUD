A Soulrender is a multi-class Shaman/Reaver.

Notes on Soulrender:
Shamans use totems, and memorize spells without spellbooks.
Reavers memorize and require spellbooks.
If you start as a Shaman, you will memorize spells, but you will no longer
need totems or spellbooks, for ANY of your spells.
If you start as a Reaver, you will also memorize spells, but you will
need spellbooks for all of your reaver AND your shaman spells.
