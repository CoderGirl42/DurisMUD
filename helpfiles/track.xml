Syntax:         track &lt;victim&gt;
                track off
Aggressive:     No

This allows you to track your quarry. How successfully you track down a
potential victim depends on your skill level and how far away your target
is. You can not track down specific racewar enemies, even if you happen to
know the name of a particularly notorious foe. When you have given up the
trail, you must type 'track off' in order stop tailing the quarry.
