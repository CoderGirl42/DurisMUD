When you create a character on Duris you have the option of creating it as
&quot;Hardcore&quot;. These characters are enhanced in most areas such as they do
increased damage, have greater resistance to damage and have higher hp than
non-hardcore characters. Hardcore characters also do not require the
special &quot;potions&quot; as others do to move past level 50, they are able to
simply exp right up to level 56. However they have a limited li e-span and
will cease to exist completely upon the fifth death of the character.
