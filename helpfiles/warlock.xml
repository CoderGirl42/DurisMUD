Warlocks are malevolent practitioners of dark, forbidden magics that
have only been mastered by the Undead.  Their powers are based neither
in the conventional magics practiced by mortals, nor in the power of the
mind like the illithids.  Warlocks tap into the dark realm of the 
negative material plane, but the greater part of their energy comes from
the bowels of hell itself.  The nature of their power not only vanquishes
their enemies, it also increases the Warlock's own power and energy.  Any 
simple mortal attempting to dabble in such horrid sorcery would almost 
surely be annihilated immediately.

Allowable races:        Vampire, Lich, Shade

Innate Abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.

Equipment usage:        Warlock fall under the Priest classification
                        of item restriction.  This means they are
                        restricted to use of non-edged weapons such as
                        maces, clubs and staves. They can wear almost 
                        any type of armor, but are mildly restricted 
                        in the use of miscellaneous magical items.
