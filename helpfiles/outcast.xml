	<title>OUTCAST</title>
<content>
Players are outcasted from hometowns for many reasons. If you are an
outcast in a city it means you will not be &quot;well liked&quot; if you go there.
The guards will hunt you down and kill you. Outcasting is permanent and can
NOT be reversed. Some reasons for being outcasted are:

* Race: Some hometowns are not accepting of other races.

For example: ALL RACES except Grey Elves, Half-Elves and Centaurs are
considered invaders to Charing and will be killed on sight.
