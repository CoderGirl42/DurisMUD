Various &quot;Ingredients&quot; are located throughout the world, buried under the 
ground. Herbs, Garlic, Nightshade, Mandrake Roots and Dragon's Blood are
just a few of the many ingredients that exist. Alchemists require stock-
piles of these ingredients in order to &quot;Mix&quot; their potions. Whereas, 
Forest Druids only require Herbs. You can gather ingredients via the
&quot;Forage&quot; command.
