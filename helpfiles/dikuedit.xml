Duris has its very own zone editor called dikuEdit, created by Tavril. This
allows zones to be created much easier if you are familiar with the Duris
world, as it gives you both the look and feel of being in the MUD itself.
For more information or to download it, visit http://duris.no-ip.com/ and
click on DOWNLOADS. For a list of zones currently in Duris, type &quot;credits&quot;.
