<R>This spell is currently inactive.</R>
Area of effect: Zone
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     Yes, but only once per hour
Duration:       Until the weather changes again (on the hour)
Type of spell:  Generic
Syntax:         cast 'control weather' &lt;cold | warm | wet |
                                         dry | calm | windy&gt;

By imagining a change in the weather, the caster is able to influence the
atmosphere conditions toward the desired state. Susceptibility to change
will vary according to the initial conditions at the time of casting. The
spell lasts for one hour, during which time no further attempts to control
the weather will be possible, as the magic becomes a part of the atmosphere
itself, resisting change.

The caster of &quot;control weather&quot; can affect the weather in dramatic ways,
having the power to bring forth rain and storm, wind and cold, from his or
her fingertips.
