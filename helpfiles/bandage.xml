Syntax:         bandage &lt;victim&gt;

The bandage skill can be used to save a player who is mortally wounded.
By bandaging, the player will begin to regenerate hitpoints once again, 
thereby saving their life. Players cannot bandage players while either
the bandager or the recipient is in combat.
