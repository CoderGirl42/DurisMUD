Syntax:    trophy

The trophy list is a feature which lets you gain a general idea of the
amount of experience (relative to a particular mob) you are gaining  or the 
mobs you kill. The trophy ensures that you do not gain experience by 
&quot;sitting on mobs&quot; as the more you kill any particular mob, the less
experience you will gain for it. If you kill too many of any particular
mob, you will eventually gain no experience at all for it.

The trophy list will help your decisions by letting you know how many of
any particular mob you have already killed. If you are in a group, you
will only gain a portion of that kill added to your trophy. Therefore,
you will see percentages on your trophy list. Trophy entries will also
change colors as the amount of experience you get for a kill becomes
less and less.
