&quot;Judgement&quot; calls down holy retribution down upon everyone and everything in 
the same room unfortunate enough to be evil or undead. This mighty spell has 
a chance of incapacitating its victims in a variety of unpleasant manners. 
Victims that are sufficiently lower level than the attacking Paladin suffer 
more dire consequences.
