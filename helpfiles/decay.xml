After a set amount of time all corpses will decay. Corpses of NPCs will
decay and leave the equipment scattered on the floor. After a crash or
reboot, these corpses are not loaded. Corpses of players will decay in time
following a death. The equipment will also be scattered on the ground. So,
following a death, it is important to retrieve your corpse in a timely
manner. Corpses of players will, however, load after a reboot or crash. 
Player corpses currently decay after approximately 2 hours. The decay time 
is reset if the game reboots or crashes before the corpse has decayed. The
spells preserve and embalm may prolong the time until a corpse decays.
