The Fighter, as the name suggests, is a class that involves hand-to-hand 
combat most extensively. They are usually the first to charge into battle 
and are almost always the ones that stand at the head of a fighting group 
(&quot;acting as tank,&quot; it is commonly called). They sustain most of the battle 
damage.

Fighters represent a group of classes into which Berserkers, Warriors,
Rangers, Reavers, Paladins, Anti-Paladins, Monks and Dreadlords are grouped. 
Each sub-class has its own experience chart according to which they gain 
levels.

NOTE: Use &quot;help &lt;classname&gt;&quot; for information on each of the sub-classes.
