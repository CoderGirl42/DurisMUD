Syntax:  memorize | pray (while resting)
         memorize &lt;spellname&gt; | pray &lt;spellname&gt; (while resting)
         forget &lt;spellname&gt;

&quot;Memorize&quot; and &quot;Pray&quot; let you put a spell in your active repertoire. To 
successfully memorize or pray for a spell, you must be holding or have in 
your inventory the appropriate item, dependent on your class. Magic-User 
subclasses must have a spellbook which contains the scribed spell to 
successfully memorize it.

Memorizing or praying without specifying a spellname allows you to
resume your studies/prayers and lists the time remaining to complete
each spell.

&quot;Forget&quot; lets you purge a spell from your active repertoire.
