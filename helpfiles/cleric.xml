Clerics are holy and powerful spell casters who obtain their magical power
from the gods and goddesses they worship. Their primary goal is to spread
the word of their faith and to bring good to the world. Most of the
Cleric's spell arsenal is defensive and healing in nature, making them one
of the most integral parts of a group.

Allowable races:        Human, Drow Elf, Grey Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, 
                        Half-Elf, Gnome, Orc, Goblin, Duergar Dwarf
Innate abilities:       God Call
Equipment usage:  	Like all classes on Duris, Clerics have their own
                        specific item restrictions. They are restricted in
                        their use of weapons, mainly using maces, clubs and
                        staves. Some exceptions	are allowed, however. They
                        can wear almost any type of armor, but are mildly
                        restricted in the use of miscellaneous magical
                        items.
