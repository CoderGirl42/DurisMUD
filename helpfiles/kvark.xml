<content>
Kvark is a language script created by the MUD with the intention of
destroying the English language as much as possible, occasionally it does 
not work properly and gets English right, but more often than not it works 
perfectly and generates totally indecipherable bits of gibberish. Often 
Kvark gets into the code, while sometimes providing useful features, most 
often makes the code un-readable and broken.
