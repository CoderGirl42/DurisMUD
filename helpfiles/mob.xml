	<title>MOB MOBILE</title>
<content>
The term &quot;mob&quot; will be something you'll hear often on Duris, a shortening
of the word &quot;mobile&quot;.  A mob is usually referred to as an NPC, a monster in
the game that isn't played by a person, but rather acts on its own as
designated by the creator of it.  Mobs are attacked and killed for
experience and equipment, as well as other reasons.
