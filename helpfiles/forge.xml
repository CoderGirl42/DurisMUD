	<title>FORGE FORGING</title>
<content>
Forging is one of the primary skills of the Alchemist Class. By collecting
material pieces	from the corpses of dead mobs an alchemist can forge a wide 
range of weapons that can be used or sold at shops. 

Forging is much like Crafting in that the more items you have the bigger
weapons you can make, and works in much the same way, except that you do
not specify the &quot;material&quot;.

Select only the materials you want to use, place them into your inventory
and type:

     forge weapon-type
     
For example, if you have two of &quot;a cracked magical steel piece&quot; in your
inventory and type &quot;forge dagger&quot; you may end up with a dagger called &quot;a
crude steel dagger&quot;. 

Identifying the item after it is created will show you the stats. The
quality of the material used, your skill in forging and your current level
all play a part in how powerful your newly forged weapons become. We are
not giving out material formulas as it is a closely guarded alchemist
secret and nobody wants a guild of alchemists on their back.
