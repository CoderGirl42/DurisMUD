Your race is defined by the path you choose to take in the Land of Duris.
Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses and your race should be 
chosen carefully. The following races are currently available on Duris 
DikuMUD:

Human, Barbarian, Drow Elf, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Duergar
Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Ogre, Minotaur, Goblin, Swamp Troll, Thri-Kreen,
Centaur, Githyanki, Orc, Storm Giant, Vampire, Lich, Wight,
Shadow Beast, Death Knight, Phantom, Shade, Revenant, Harpy

Note: If you are new to Duris, it is recommended that you play a &quot;goodie&quot;
race character, as the other sides are designed much more toward highly
advanced players. The good side races are as follows: Human, Barbarian,
Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Mountain Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Centaur and Storm
Giant or Harpy.

For more information on each race, type &quot;help &lt;racename&gt;.&quot;  This will give
you a brief description of each race, its strengths and weaknesses, the
bonus system that applies to it, and its innate abilities, if any. It will
also tell you which classes are available for that race.

For information about the general theme of Duris, with particular attention
to the division between good, evil and undead races, type &quot;help racewars.&quot;
