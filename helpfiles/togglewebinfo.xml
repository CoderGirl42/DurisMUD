Syntax:         toggle webinfo

In the interests of providing an informative and interactive website, we
develop and show statistics about such things as Top Players, PvP kills and
equipment worn during raids on the website.

This toggle allows us to display more information over and above the
general, non-sensitive information like frag and experience progress. One
of the things toggling this setting to OFF will restrict is EQ display, and
other such more specific character information.

Please note, that any such information shown on the website has an 30
minute delay before release.

If you do not wish more specific information shown, please ensure that this
option is set to OFF. It is by default OFF.
