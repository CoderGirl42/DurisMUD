&quot;Look&quot; is used for studying your surroundings and is more often used in its
short form variation of &quot;l.&quot;

Eg : look
     l
     look dragon
     look at board
     look board
     l at board
     look in bag
     l in bag
     l in 2.bag (if you have more than one bag)
     l south
     l candle (if there's an extra description of a candle in a room)

Note that if you type &quot;look at &lt;container&gt;&quot; you will not see its contents.
To see what's inside a container (e.g., a corpse), use the syntax &quot;look IN
&lt;object&gt;.&quot; For this type of inspection, it's best to use the command
&quot;examine.&quot;

&quot;Look&quot; is also used when utilizing one of Duris's many ships, although with
different syntax.
