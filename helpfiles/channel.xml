Channel is one of the most powerful s ells of a cleric and should be used
with great caution. It requires four clerics over level 50 to work, and
creates an avatar bringing the power of all the clerics together. First,
all the clerics must be grouped and consenting to &quot;lead&quot; cleric. They begin
casting the spell together until the avatar appears. The lead cleric then
takes control of the avatar, while the other clerics can simply watch. The
actual body of the clerics are left laying asleep where they are, but the
&quot;lead&quot; cleric, in avatar form, can move around, cast, etc.  

Warning: If ANY one of the clerics loses link during the avatar process,
the avatar will vanish. There IS a time limit on how often clerics can
avatar.
