In Sarmiz'Duul, you will find a pub that has several crews for hire.

Syntax:

-==Sail Crews==-
Standard Crew        Repair Rating:20      Cost: Free (starting crew)
Veteran Crew         Repair Rating:30      Cost: 2000 platinum
Elite Crew           Repair Rating:40      Cost: 5000 platinum

-==Gun Crews==-
Standard Crew        Stamina:70            Cost: Free (starting crew)
Veteran Archers      Stamina:100           Cost: 2000 platinum
Elite Catapult Crew  Stamina:130           Cost: 5000 platinum
Stamina Crew         Stamina:200           Cost: 750 platinum

Veteran crews (of both types) require 500 ship frags to purchase.
Elite crews require 1000 ship frags to purchase.

It is rumored that an expert machinist has perfected the construction of
Automoton crews, but most believe this to be just a rumor.
Under the <Y>remote</Y> possibility it <Y>were</Y> true, it would require an <R>INSANE</R>
number of ship frags for him to even <Y>consider</Y> selling you the crews.

Each crew has an experience level that looks like this:  5/10
The lower number is how much exp your crew currently has, and the higher
number is the max exp that crew can achieve.

If your ship frags drops below the amount needed to purchase that crew
you will lose that crew.

At the moment, experience is a reflection of your ship frags:
200 ship frags = 2 experience.
500 ship frags = 5 experience.
