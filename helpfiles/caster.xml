&quot;Caster&quot; is a term that is used to described &quot;Magic-User&quot; and &quot;Priest&quot;
classes. It is used in referring to classes that are highly adept in the 
magical arts and who focus their studies solely on these crafts. Casters 
include Clerics, Conjurers, Warlocks, Ethermancers, Druids, Necromancers, 
Shamans, Psionicists, Illusionists and Sorcerers. Casters receive no 
penalties to their casting abilities.

The term &quot;Semi-Caster&quot; denotes an entirely different set of classes who, 
while not being as proficient in the magical arts, do dabble in the mystic 
areas. Because they do not devote their lives to the practice of magic, 
they have special hindrances. While being able to use many of the same 
spells as casters, semi-casters can only hold half the number of spells in
their repertoire that a caster of same level can. In addition, because they 
are not as trained in magic, they find it a bit more difficult to memorize 
their incantations and to call on their deities for divine powers. Hence, 
semi-casters must take a little additional time in preparing their magic. 
Semi-casters include Anti-Paladins, Paladins, Rangers, Reaver, Bards and
Unholy-Pipers.
