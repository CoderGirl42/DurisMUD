	<title>"BLOOD ALLIANCE"</title>
<content>
A Blood Reaver may find a willing target to have an alliance in blood with
them. Once they are linked, if one of them drops below 50% of their health
and the other has more than 70%, then damage to the weaker triggers some
transfer of hitpoints from the stronger to the weaker member. This spell
is usually used to link Blood Reavers with anti-paladins causing them to
form a dark and terrible evil plague.
