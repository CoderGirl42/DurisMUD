On Duris, artifacts, uniques, and iouns are in need of &quot;feeding&quot;, which
means killing someone of the opposite racewar in order to gain a full frag.
You must reach one full frag to sate your artifact within a number of days
which varies between each item.  If you fail to feed, your artifact will
be removed and placed back into the game where it loads, if any.
