Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster or until dispelled
Type of spell:  Protection

&quot;Deflect&quot; is a rather potent protectorate that reflects any spell cast at
the protected Mage back at the caster. The enemy caster then absorbs the
same adverse effects from the spell that he cast. &quot;Deflect&quot; will expire
after a successful attack from an offensive spell.
