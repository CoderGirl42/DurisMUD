<content>
Sacrifice and rituals preformed to create the Dreadlords have so imbued
their undead bodies with unholy malice that even their blood drips with the
curse of it. Beware of fighting the Dreadlord for even the splatter of it's
blood upon you in battle will burn through your armor and melt the flesh of
your bones.
