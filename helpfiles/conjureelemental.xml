Area of effect: One elemental
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Instantaneous
Type of spell:  Summoning

When cast, &quot;Conjure Elemental&quot; summons an elemental from a random elemental
plane which will follow the player as though charmed for a limited period
of time. There is no way to control which type of elemental is summoned.

If the elemental is aggressive when the charm wears off, it will attack you
and others.
