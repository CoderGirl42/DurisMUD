<content>
Unlike their cousins the drow, grey elves live on the surface and prefer to
dwell in forests. They are exceptionally intelligent and swift, but are
inclined to be weaker and smaller than humans. Grey elves have a good-
natured disposition and tend to love animals and nature, although they
loathe drow. They are born with infravision, but, unlike drow, can see
perfectly in daylight.

Class list:       Warrior, Ranger, Cleric, Conjurer, Druid, Sorcerer,
                  Thief, Bard.
Statistics:       Elves tend to be weaker and frailer than Humans, but are
                  also quicker and more intelligent. Grey elves also have
                  an innate resistance to magic attacks.
Innate abilities: infravision, outdoor sneak
