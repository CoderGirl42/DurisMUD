	<title>LINK LAG</title>
	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
Many players have problems with their links to the game. This could be very
dangerous to your health in the middle of combat. However, we at Duris feel
it is unfair to place the responsibility for quality of the link on us.
Thus, deaths and injury due to link loss are not our problem.

If your link freezes up for some reason, a god will usually be willing to
release the link, letting you reconnect. If the system that runs the MUD
itself freezes up, your character will not be harmed, as everything and
everyone else in the game will also be frozen. However, if another system
en route to this one lags, you will be put in a dangerous position and your
character could die.

If the network looks shaky, don't put your character in a dangerous
position, as we will NOT reimburse you for losses.

If your WIMPY toggle is enabled, you will automatically flee when your hit
points reach the wimpy level.
