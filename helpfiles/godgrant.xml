	<title>"GOD, GRANT" "GOD, REVOKE"</title>
<content>
Syntax:  grant &lt;player&gt; &lt;command&gt;

&quot;Grant&quot; lets you grant a player a command normally above their level, until
someone uses &quot;revoke&quot; to remove the ability. Be VERY careful in its usage.
The grantable commands form a limited subset of god commands. You can only
revoke a command that was previously granted.
