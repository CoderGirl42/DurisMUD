<content>
A &quot;hometown&quot; is a city of a particular race of Duris. There are numerous
hometowns across the land, and you will start in your race's birth 
hometown when you enter the game. When you die, you will respawn in the
city of your birth, unless you have paid to reset your home to another 
place (see help home). 

Some of these Hometowns include:

   -Tharnadia, the Birthplace of Humans
   -Charing, City of Elves
