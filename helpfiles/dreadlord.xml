Dreadlords, also knows as the Eyeless, are the warlords of the undead. They
are the result of a dark and terrible ritual performed on a person. The end
of the ritual is marked by the person sacrificing his eyes by clawing them
out and then giving his life to the Dark Lords. If he is deemed worthy he
will once again rise, this time as an undead, a Dreadlord. If he is not
deemed worthy he has an eternity in the pits of hell to ponder his
arrogance. The loss of their eyes does not, as many believe, encumber the
Eyeless in any way. Instead they are giving a seventh sense by which they
can perceive their surroundings. This also makes them immune against
blindness and other things that would normally affect eyesight, such as
daylight and darkness, yet sensitive to extremes of heat. A Dreadlord is a
feared fighter, a master in the use of two-handed weapons, spreading the
taint of the dead as they fight. Even their blood can kill. They are also
trained in the art of leading and are deadly while commanding a force.  

Allowable races:        Lich, Vampire, Shade.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Dreadlords have their
                        own item restrictions. They can use most heavy
                        armor and weapons but are more limited in using
                        magical items.
Innate Abilities:	Acid Blood, Inability to Blind.
