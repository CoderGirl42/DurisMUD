Syntax:  give &lt;object&gt; &lt;target&gt;

If you feel charitable, you may want to give items to someone in need.

Example:  &quot;give bread beggar&quot;

Money, in the form of various types of coinage, is a little more
difficult to give away.

Syntax:  give &lt;amount&gt; &lt;coin_type&gt; &lt;target&gt;

Giving very heavy objects, or 1000s of coins, or anything that will
overload the receiver, requires the receiver's consent.
