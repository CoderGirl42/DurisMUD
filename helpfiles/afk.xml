Common acronyms used by players. These terms are commonly used on Duris by
players rather than typing out the full words. They mean:

     AFK   -away from keyboard
     BRB   -be right back
     BBL   -be back later
     OMG   -oh my goodness

They are also socials that can be used by simply typing them, announcing to
a person or the room. You can type &quot;command socials&quot; for a full list.
