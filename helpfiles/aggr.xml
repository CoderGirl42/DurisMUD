<content>
&quot;Aggr&quot; lets you make yourself aggressive to aggressive monsters, meaning
you will automatically attack them first when you enter a room or when an
aggressive monster walks in on you.

Syntax: &gt; aggr          : Check aggressiveness
        &gt; aggr off      : Turn off aggressiveness
        &gt; aggr 120      : You will only be aggressive to monsters when
                        : your hitpoints &gt;=120

NOTE: Paladins may *not* have this option set to ON, as it goes against all
their training and principles.
