Gods are people who have obtained level 57 or above. They should be
respected for having met and overcome the challenges of Duris DikuMUD.
However, there are certain rules by which they must abide:

1. They must not interfere with or hinder mortals.
2. Immortals cannot give out information such as: statistics of a player,
   statistics of items or other private information.
3. They cannot kill mortals. 
4. Immortals cannot give away objects or equipment.
5. They must not use their immortal to gather information later used on
   their mortal.
6. Breaking any of these rules will subject the immortal to immediate
   demotion.

Nobody likes rules, but we need them to keep the game fun and interesting.
