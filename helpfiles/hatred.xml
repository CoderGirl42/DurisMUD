<content>
Dwarves are as changeable as the rock they came from but as a result they
also never forget. Many are the long wars fought against the invading orcs
and the battles against the duergar dwarves and drow elves. Over the 
passing millennia deep hatred has grown into the hearts of all dwarves 
and they will battle this evil anywhere and everywhere. A result of this 
hatred is a rage that will help a dwarf to keep on fighting when others 
others would tire and to fight with determination unheard of.
