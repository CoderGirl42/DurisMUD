&quot;Consent&quot; is a check performed by the MUD code in order to confirm that a
player (victim) is agreeing to the action being performed upon him or her
by another player.

Usage:
consent &lt;name&gt; -you give your undying trust to &lt;name&gt;
consent        -you revoke consent
consent who    -lists all players that have given you consent

You may only consent to one person at a time, but you can change it as
often as you wish. The person you are consenting to need not be in the
room with you, but you must be able to see him/her. (If who &lt;name&gt; doesn't
work, neither will consent &lt;name&gt;).
