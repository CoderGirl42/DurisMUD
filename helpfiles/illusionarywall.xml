Area of effect: direction
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster 
Type of spell:  Illusion

This spell creates an illusion that effectively hides normal exits from
the naked eye. Anyone attempting to try and exit in the direction that this 
wall exists has a chance to disbelieve the illusion and pass. One can also
try to search the area around where the exit once was and may find the wall
thus negating the effects.
