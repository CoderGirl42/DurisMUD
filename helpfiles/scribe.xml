Syntax:         hold quill | hold spellbook
                scribe &lt;spell&gt;       : copy from book/scroll in inventory
	        practice &lt;spell&gt;     : learn a spell from a teacher in room


In order for a Magic-User to cast spells, they must first possess a
spellbook filled with spells to cast. To do this, you must have a spellbook, 
quill and either a teacher mob or another player's already scribed 
spellbook. Once you are holding both the quill and book, you can start to 
write them in your spellbook by typing one of the above commands, depending 
on who you are copying/learning from. Proficiency at scribing affects how 
quickly a Magic-User will inscribe new spells into his/her spellbook when 
practicing or adding new spells.
