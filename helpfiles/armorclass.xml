	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
The lower your character's AC (acronym for &quot;Armor Class&quot;), the less chance
he or she will have of getting injured by physical attacks. Armor class
numbers often run into the negatives (good!) and it is not uncommon for an
extremely high-level player to have -100 AC.

Examples:
   100          Naked person
     0          Heavily armored
   -51          Very heavily armored
  -100          Nigh-unhittable

NOTE: Within the mud code, armor classes are actually calculated on a -10
to 10 scale. Why? Because THAC0's are calculated on a 0-20 scale, and thus
must be equated against a -10 to 10 armor class scale instead of a -100 to
100 scale. What does this mean to you? It means that as far as the mud is
concerned, if you have, for instance, a -55 armor class, you *really* only
have a -50 armor class. The values are all rounded off to the closest ten.
So, when you are choosing your equipment, disregard those few extra armor
class points unless they take you over the next 10th number value.

The help entry under THAC0 further explains this hit/miss system.
