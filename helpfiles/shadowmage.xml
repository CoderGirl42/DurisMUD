<content>
The Master of the paths of magic and silent transference. A Shadowmage 
deeply studied will not feel the discomfort, unease and disorientation as 
other casters do upon using spells such as teleport, relocate and dimension 
door. They can also &quot;Blink&quot; out of the way causing foes hitting them bodily 
to fall as they fail their swing, possibly causing them to abort offensive 
magics against this Mage.
