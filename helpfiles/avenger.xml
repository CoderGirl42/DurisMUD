Avengers are the faithful servants of Gods, bringing justice to their evil
enemies. They are recruited from the most dedicated paladins willing to
sacrifice their lives entirely to the God's service. A Paladin becomes an
Avenger through Ascension, when he sacrifices the ability to enjoy mortal
pleasures and is imbued with God's might. Avengers no longer see like
other mortals, thus they cannot be blinded. They are surrounded by holy
light and their eyes emanate with internal glow. Rumors say they are able
to paralyze their foes solely through staring at them.
The Avengers can use all kinds of heavy armors but limit themselves to
powerful, 2-handed swords only. 

Allowable races:        Human, Half-Elf.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Avengers have their
                        own item restrictions. They can use most heavy
                        armor and weapons but are more limited in using
                        magical items.
Innate Abilities:	Inability to Blind, God Call, Magic Resistance.
