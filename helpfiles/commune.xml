Unlike most spellcasters, Druids do not need to memorize or pray. They have
allied themselves with the natural world so well that they commune with 
their surroundings to derive the natural essence that is necessary for
their spells. This essence is more abundant in untamed wilds. What this
means is, Druids will regenerate their spells, while standing, at a rate that 
varies dependent on what terrain they are in.

Type 'commune' for a list of spells that are being regenerated back.
