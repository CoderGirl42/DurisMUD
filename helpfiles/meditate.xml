Syntax:         meditate (while resting)

&quot;Meditate&quot; allows the player to memorize/pray for spells with a chance of
halving the time. A single proficiency check is made at the half way point
for each spell. If successful, the spell will be memorized/prayed for at
that time. If unsuccessful, the spell will take the normal time before it
is memorized/prayed. Because meditate is the focusing of the mind, most
actions will stop the meditation.
