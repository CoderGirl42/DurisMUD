THAC0 is an acronym for &quot;To Hit Armor Class 0&quot;. THAC0 is a number every 
player and monster has and it is dependent on level and class. It is ranged
between 0 and 20. THAC0 is the method that the MUD code uses to determine 
whether or not you have successfully &quot;hit&quot; an opponent while in battle. It 
is calculated for everyone fighting, for each and every combat round. For 
THAC0's, the lower the number you have, the better success you will have at 
hitting.

For example: Let's say your THAC0 is 10, meaning you have to roll between 
10 and 20 on a 20-sided die in order to hit an enemy with an armor class of 
0. If you are fighting a monster with an armor class of 1, then you need to 
roll between 11 and 20 to hit that mob. If the mob's armor class is 8, you 
only need to roll between 2 and 20 in order to hit that monster. You can 
affect your THAC0 by using magical items that give a positive hitroll bonus.  
This bonus will enhance your THAC0 and therefore your ability to hit a 
monster.

The help entry for AC (Armor Class) further explains how this hit/miss
system works.
