Syntax:         shout &lt;text&gt;
                toggle shout

&quot;Shout&quot; sends a message to all players within a certain range of you. If 
you are in a zone, the message will only be heard by those in that  
particular zone. If you are on the world map, the message will only be  
heard by those on that particular continent. In order to hear shouts, you 
must be conscious and have shout toggled on.
