	<category type="Sub-Class of: Rogue"/>
<content>
Blessed with the talent of music, Bards can, with practice, play any
instrument. These instruments can invoke magical tunes and songs that act
as spells, aiding a party during their adventures. Bards are a thief/mage/
warrior hybrid by nature, and possess some of the advantages of all of
those classes. They are true &quot;Jacks of all Trade&quot; which means they have
many skills and spells, but are master of none.  

Allowable races:        Grey Elf, Drow Elf, Half-Elf, Human, Halfling,
			Goblin, Githyanki, Orc, Harpy
Innate abilities:       None
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, bards have their own set
                        of equipment they can use. Bards can use most
                        weapons, and armor, also many magic items.
