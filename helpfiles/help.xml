  Duris help is divided into two sections: HELP and INFO. The HELP section
  deals with the everyday functions, policies and stuff you need to know in
  order to play successfully here on Duris. The INFO section gives you the
  background on each of the gods here, and will be expanded to include the
  general background on each of the mobs (monsters) you may encounter here.
