	<title>GNOME</title>
<content>
Gnomes are small, sturdy humanoids who are well known for their quick hands
and good humor. Smaller and weaker than humans, gnomes have more wit to
compensate. Gnomes have colonies of their own, but are commonplace among
the major surface communities. Gnomes and dwarves are distantly related,
and gnomes often understand dwarves fairly well. Gnomes have permanent
infravision.

Classes:    Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Sorcerer, Conjurer, Thief, Alchemist,
            Illusionist.
Statistics: Gnomes have very quick minds, but seem to lack the wisdom to
            use that intelligence well. Their bodies are also fairly quick,
            which is probably good, because they are also weak, and not
            very appealing.
Innates:    Infravision, Farsee.
