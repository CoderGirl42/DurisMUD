Once you have selected the race of being you wish to play, you must select
a class. A class is the trade or profession at which your character will
excel. Not all classes are available for each race, as it would be highly
unlikely that an unintelligent, clumsy troll would take up the demanding
profession of assassin. There are four main &quot;types&quot; of classes (Fighters,
Priests, Rogues and Magic-Users) available, and the available classes are
listed below the headings of each one.
