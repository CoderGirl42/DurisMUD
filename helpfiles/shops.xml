	<title>SHOPS SHOPKEEPER</title>
<content>
Shops are places where players may purchase equipment for their
adventuring needs or sell extra items and treasures.  Many shops trade
only in specific types of merchandise, or may not have enough money to
pay you what your item's true value is.  Thus, a baker or an armorer
may refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!

To some people, murdering the keeper in the prospect of obtaining the
entire inventory of a shop, or gaining a large amount of experience
points may appear tempting, but beware!  Shopkeepers are often rugged,
capable men and women who are roughened by years of trading and
surviving in a harsh world.  Killing them may not be as easy as it
looks!
