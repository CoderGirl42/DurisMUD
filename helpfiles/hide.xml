Hide -Rogue Class Skill
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide

&quot;Hide&quot; allows you to cleverly conceal yourself from the occupants of a room, 
regardless of whether they are other players or creatures. As with the 
&quot;Sneak&quot; command, there is always a chance that you will not hide 
successfully and your failure to do so will not be obvious to you. If your
attempt to hide is successful, you can only be detected by &quot;Sense Life&quot;, 
&quot;Infravision&quot; or &quot;Faerie Fog&quot; . To break the hiding, issue any command. The 
effect will wear off after a period of time.

Hide -General Command
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:         hide &lt;object&gt;

Hide is a command you can use to conceal an object within the room. The
object you are trying to hide must be dropped and on the floor of the room
before you can conceal it. When you &quot;look&quot;, this item should no longer 
appear in the room. You may &quot;search&quot; the room to re-discover the hidden 
item.
