<content>
&quot;Tolm&quot; is often referred to a player on Duris, who can often be found
repeating such phrases as &quot;wuss&quot;, &quot;enjoy&quot;, &quot;rofl&quot;, and &quot;at once&quot;. If in
close contact with Tolm, one should be aware he commonly passes large
amounts of gaseous flatulence, causing a tremendous stench to fill the room
and killing all those within it. Choosing to follow Tolm can result in 
instantaneous death, as he can often times be remembered as spamming 
through a high aggro area and leaving his comrades behind. In reality,
though, Tolm is simply a bot created by the gods of Duris for their 
amusement. Paying close attention, one might notice his responses to things 
are quite limited, as shown above. Great care should be taken when dealing
with Tolm.
