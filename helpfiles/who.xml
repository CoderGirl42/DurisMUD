Syntax:         who                (for listing of visible players)
                who ?              (for a complete list of valid arguments)
                who &lt;argument&gt;     (for a more specialized listing)
                
This command lists the people currently in the game, the level(s) they have 
achieved and their titles. Gods are listed first in the who list, then 
mortal characters.

<R>NOTE</R>: On Duris, &quot;Who&quot; will only show the races that are of a like
     alignment. So, for example, an Evil person typing &quot;Who&quot; will only see
     other Evil PC's. The same holds true for Good races.
