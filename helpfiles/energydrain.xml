&quot;Energy Drain&quot; literally drains the lifeblood from the victim, as it feeds 
on the energy of life itself. Although it does not do much damage to the 
victim, a successful spell cast causes the victim to lose energy, and the 
caster then gains a fraction of this life force, movement points, and mana.

The gods consider such an act upon another living being extremely evil and 
casting it will thus affect how evil you are perceived in the world.
