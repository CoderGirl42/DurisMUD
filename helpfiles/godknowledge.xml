Mortals on any MUD can often get lost or have problems that are far beyond
their control. This generally occurs no matter how well-coded a MUD is.

Thus there WILL be situations where you are the only god around and a
problem will arise. It is your responsibility as a god to know the MUD, its
policies, and its general workings, so that you might be able to help out
when something goes wrong. If you encounter a problem that you feel only a
higher god or Forger can handle, refer the problem up the ladder. There is
nothing wrong with doing that, nor is it a bad thing to do. Actually, if
you are in doubt as to the wisdom of your decision, it is often more
advantageous to do this than make an incorrect ruling.

However, we don't want a bunch of gods running around who know nothing
about the mud, and who can't answer simple questions that a mortal might
ask. If you don't feel knowledgeable enough about things, try to learn so
you will be ready.

Remember, you represent our entire MUD when you talk one-on-one with a
mortal. You are the god, and your actions will reflect heavily upon us all.
One god who m kes a dumb mistake with a wrong person could spell disaster.
Bad publicity on the Internet and in the Usenet newsgroups would be very
damaging, not to mention embarrassing.

So, in synopsis, if there is a problem beyond your control, don't blow 'em
off. Get help.
