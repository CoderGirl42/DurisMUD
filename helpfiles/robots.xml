	<title>ROBOTS ACTIONS</title>
<content>
A robot is a character that can run independently by triggers and/or
actions through a client such as Tin-Tin. Actions are allowed on Duris for
such things as eating, drinking, retrieving weapons, and looting corpses.
However, if you can leave the keyboard for an extended amount of time,
chances are you are running a robot.
