Syntax:  wield &lt;weapon&gt;

In order to use a weapon, it must be wielded. Some weapons require great 
strength to wield them and may be too heavy for your character to use. Some
classes have the skill of using two weapons. It should be noted, however, 
that the skill &quot;double attack&quot; (allowing you to hit twice) can only be used
with your primary weapon. You cannot hold anything else if wielding two 
weapons (unless you are a thri-kreen).
