Syntax:         circle &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes

Circling is an attempt to backstab the opponent while in combat. This is
only possible if you are not tanking, i.e., the target of the opponent who
is taking the damage.

&quot;Circle&quot; also refers to spheres of knowledge of spell casting classes, with
higher circles denoting more powerful groups of spells. Spell casters (all
Mage and Priest sub-classes) and &quot;semi-casters&quot; (Rangers, Paladins, and
Anti-Paladins) gain in circle at levels 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 41, and
46.
