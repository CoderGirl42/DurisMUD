Rangers are Fighters who are trained and skilled at woodland survival and
techniques. They are one with nature and they are the best in the world at
two-weapon combat. Although, Rangers are not quite as generally skilled in 
battle as Warriors are, they have the advantage of possessing limited 
spell-casting abilities. These abilities are granted to them once they 
progress upward in level and become powerful enough to use the magic as a 
reward for their mastery of woodland survival.

Allowable races:  Human, Grey Elf, Half-Elf, Centaur
Innate abilities: Outdoor Sneak
Equipment usage:  Rangers have their own classification of item
                  restriction. They can use almost all weapons and most
                  types of armor. They are somewhat limited in their use of
                  miscellaneous magical items.     

<R>NOTE</R>: Rangers must stay good aligned or else they lose their magical
     abilities until they mend their ways.
