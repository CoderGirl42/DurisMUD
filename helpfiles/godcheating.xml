	<title>"GOD, CHEATING"</title>
<content>
This is a sensitive issue on any MUD. Cheating degrades the environment and
can do considerable damage to a MUD's reputation when it occurs.

Thus, on Duris, we have developed a very strict policy toward cheating, and
you MUST understand it. This policy is simple and to the point:

     If you are caught cheating with your god, you will be deleted
     from the MUD. You will lose all of your god powers and there
     will be no questions asked and no second chances.

There are no exceptions. This rulings stands for Forgers as well as all
other gods. Cheating is NOT tolerated here. We have adopted this strict
policy in order to discourage people from cheating in the first place. Just
don't do it, it's not worth the consequences if you are caught.

And, as a reminder, Duris has VERY detailed logs. Almost everything you d 
as a god is logged: loading objects, dropping things, moving about, almost
everything.

We are not trying to be policemen here, nor Big Brother. Always watching
over your shoulder waiting for you to make the wrong move. Trust is a major
factor that affects all of us gods, and without it, we would never gain any
major accomplishments. The Forgers almost never look at the logs, but they
do, occasionally, when they are bored or receive a complaint. Don't be
nervous about having your actions recorded; just don't cheat. If, by
chance, someone witnesses you cheating (as is most often the case), you are
history, period.

If you have even the remotest doubt as to whether your actions would
constitute cheating, DON'T DO IT. Put the situation on hold and consult
with a higher level god.

Thus, the policy is set. You have read it and are expected to abide by it.
