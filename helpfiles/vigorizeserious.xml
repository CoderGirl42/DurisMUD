This handy spell restores to the victim some movement, letting him or her 
travel farther. The amount of movement restored is dependent on the version 
of the spell cast. &quot;Vigorize Serious&quot; is the intermediate version of the 
spell; more powerful than &quot;Vigorize Light&quot; but less powerful than &quot;Vigorize 
Critic&quot;.
