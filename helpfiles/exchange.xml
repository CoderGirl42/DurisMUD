<content>
Banks can be found throughout the Realms, and it is the wise adventurer 
indeed that utilizes them often. Carrying large amounts of money around
with you can be hazardous: you could not only lose the cash you are
carrying if you die, but you would also be welcome prey to any thief.

You can also &quot;exchange&quot; the money that you are carrying for that of smaller
or higher denominations, usually for some surcharge. See below for correct
syntax.

The following commands can be used at any banks:

        BALANCE
        DEPOSIT &lt;amount&gt; &lt;coin_type&gt;
        WITHDRAW &lt;amount&gt; &lt;coin_type&gt;
        EXCHANGE &lt;amount&gt; &lt;coin_type&gt; &lt;desired_coin_type&gt;

Examples of monetary exchange:

        exchange 1000 gcoins pcoins
        exchange 1000 copper platinum
        exchange 5 platinum scoin
        
The standard Duris currency values equate as:

        10 copper =1 silver
        10 silver =1 gold
        10 gold =1 platinum
        
        Be aware that many banks will have a higher exchange rate as they
        like to charge an processing fee!
