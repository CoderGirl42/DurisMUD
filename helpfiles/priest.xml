Priests are individuals who choose to spread the faith of their deities 
through the use of their god-given spell-like powers. The Priest classes 
are generally charged with the vast responsibility of keeping their party
alive with their healing and defensive spells. They are also competent
fighters and can hold their own should battle come their way.

There are subclasses of Priest, each with their own specialties:
clerics, warlocks, druids, shamans and ethermancers. Clerics are the 
closest to the common image of a priest: they spread gospel and pray to 
their deities. Warlocks are Undeads that are very similar to clerics, but 
have a larger repertoire of utilitarian spells. Druids are calmer folk, who 
espouse the virtues of closeness and harmony with nature. Though, they can 
be fearsome when angered. Shamans are a primitive mixture of Priest and 
Magic-User, with some of the abilities of each, but lacking the full powers 
of either. Ethermancers use elemental magic and worship the pagan god of 
storms. The common Priest grouping means the sub-classes are affected by 
the same class-wide restrictions on equipment and are similar in to-hit 
rolls and average hit points. Each sub-class has its own experience chart 
according to which they gain levels.

NOTE: Use &quot;help &lt;classname&gt;&quot; for information on each of the sub-classes.
