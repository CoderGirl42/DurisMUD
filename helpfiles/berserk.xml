Syntax:         berserk

Berserk represents a massive adrenaline rush and more or less mindless
rage, that has the following affects:

	Strength and Constitution increase.
	Dexterity and Agility decrease.
	Intelligence and Wisdom decrease.

As a result, you will most likely gain hits and do more damage. These 
changes to stats are based on your natural abilities and bonuses from
magic items or spells apply normally. This is one of the ways a stat can
exceed the 1-100 limit.

If you wish, you can start or stop a berserker rage by typing 'berserk',
level and skill heavily affect the results  f doing this. If a mob or
player walks into a room while you are berserked and not engaged in battle
at the time, you will automatically attack them. When berserk wears off,
you will lose the bonus hitpoints from Constitution and if this drops you 
below -10 hitpoints, you will die.
