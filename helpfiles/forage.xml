Syntax: forage

&quot;Ingredients&quot; are located throughout the world of Duris, buried under the
ground. In order to retrieve these ingredients, you must &quot;Forage&quot; for them.
Some classes, such as Alchemists and Forest Druids (specialized Druids),
need specific ingredients in order to cast spells or mix potions.

<R>Warning</R>: While foraging, you cannot enter new commands for a period of 
        time, making you prone to attack. So, be sure you are relatively 
        safe before foraging!
