Mixing is one of the three primary skills of the Alchemist Class. By
combining a combination of reagents and mixing them together they can make
very powerful potions that can then be thrown at enemies.

Reagents: reagents are found by using the forage command in outdoor areas,
the current list of reagents are listed below. 

Nightshade, A Mandrake Root, A Few Drops of Dragons Blood, Garlic, A Green
Herb, Some Faerie Dust, a living stone.

In addition to reagents some of the high level potions require body parts
of dead players you can collect these by using the carve command on fallen
players.

All Alchemists will start with a basic recipe list in their inventory to
aid them in creating potions. To mix a potion simply put the needed items
into your inventory and type mix bottle.   

As an example here is the recipe for the potion of Ice Missile -garlic,
mandrake root. Make sure have 1 garlic and 1 mandrake root in your
inventory and type: mix bottle
