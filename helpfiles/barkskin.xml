Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster

This spell causes the victim's skin to toughen and harden to the consistency 
of bark, granting a significant armor class improvement and slight 
protection from melee damage. This also means there is a somewhat higher 
increase in damage from fire.
