To call upon the &quot;Essence Of The Wolf&quot;, the Animalist must enter into a
trancelike state and bestow all of his power upon one person. Once the 
chant is complete, the beneficiary of the Wolven Spirit will swell with 
tremendous physical power. The Animalist must continue the chant 
uninterrupted for the spiritual flow to remain constant. If anything
causes the chant to cease, the Essence Of The Wolf will depart.
