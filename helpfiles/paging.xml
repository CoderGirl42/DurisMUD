Syntax:         toggle paging

When this option is OFF, you will have the ability to scroll larger text 
files down your screen by hitting the enter key. When this option is ON,
if the text being displayed is small enough or you have set your screen
size large enough, you will be able to see the entire text in one
continuous stream. You may set your screen size by using the 
&quot;toggle screensize&quot; option.
