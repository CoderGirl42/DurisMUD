<content>
As it is with human nature, we all strive to obtain excellence in what
we do.  We have yet to meet a person who does not wish to be top dog,
and this is fine.

On Duris, we encourage you to participate and add to our MUD in some shape
or form. All those who add to it in a significant way will be moved up in
the chain of command. It will not be easy to move up the ladder, though.

Remember, having your god is a privilege, not a right.

If you make a nice zone or add neat features or good code to Duris, you
will be rewarded for your hard work and will move up the ladder. We, the
Forgers of the Realms, wish to encourage everyone to work hard and
contribute to the never-ending growth of our world.

We need your help!

With that said: if you work for us, you WILL be rewarded. On the other
hand, NO ONE will receive a god just because they are friends ith the
bosses or some other such garbage. We do NOT give away free gods or god
levels. Giving these away would undermine the entire principle of
participation and it would be entirely unfair to those who have worked hard
to get where they are. If you don't get the god of your choice, and want to
be higher, more work is probably the answer.

If, however, you feel you have been cheated, you may request an audience
with an Overlord, where you can voice your concerns and have them heard.
This will hopefully resolve any problems.
