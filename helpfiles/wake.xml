	<title>WAKE REST SIT STAND KNEEL RECLINE ALERT</title>
<content>
As in the real world, your character will eventually get tired and run out
of energy or get injured in the line of fire. When this occurs, you may
wish to sit and rest or sleep for a quick bit. You recover more quickly
when sleeping than when resting, and more quickly resting than standing.

Persons who are asleep may be awakened with the &quot;Wake&quot; command, although
this does not work if the sleep is magical.

The new position/status system commands are as follows:

         stand                 stand up
         sit                   sit down
         kneel                 go to your knees
         recline               lay down
         rest                  relax and sit down
         alert                 pay attention, doesn't change position
         sleep                 go to sleep, doesn't change position
         wake                  wake up, doesn't change position.
