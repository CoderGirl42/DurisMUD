The term &quot;Magic-User&quot; defines a class of individuals who spend their lives
training in the use of arcane magical spellcraft. They are the ones who
stand at the back of a party during battle and hurl powerful offensive
spells at the enemy. Because they are so powerful in their discipline, they
are typically the most frail in stature.

There are subclasses of Magic-User, each with their own specialties:
Sorcerers, Necromancers and Conjurer classes that are very specific to 
Magic-Users. Being part of the larger class-group, these classes are 
affected by the same class restrictions on equipment and are similar in 
to-hit rolls and average hit points. There are also some other classes that 
only loosely fall within the &quot;Magic-User&quot; definition, these are: 
Psionicists, Illusionists and Alchemists. These sub-classes tend to have similar 
resistances and susceptibilities to things like spells, paralysis, dragon 
breath, etc. Each sub-class rises in level according to its own experience 
chart.

NOTE: Use &quot;help &lt;classname&gt;&quot; for information on each of the sub-classes.
