Syntax:  accept &lt;charname|on|off&gt;
         decline &lt;player&gt; [&lt;reason&gt;]

These commands let you accept or decline potential character's names,
dependent on whether they meet up to the standards set forth in the
introduction at new character creation. &quot;accept off&quot; turns this acception/
decline mode off, and simply allows new characters to log on without a
god's permission.
