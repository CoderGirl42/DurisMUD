Area of effect: &lt;caster&gt; &amp; &lt;player&gt;
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Instantaneous
Type of spell:  Teleportation

&quot;Way of the Wind&quot; creates an artery in the ether barely big enough to 
accommodate the caster and flings him all the way to the person he selected 
as his target, no matter how far away his target may be.
 
<R>Warning:</R> Sometimes this artery can rupture, depositing the caster 
someplace completely unexpected (and perhaps very dangerous).
