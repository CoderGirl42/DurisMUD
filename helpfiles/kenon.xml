Realizing their mistake with the Kvark language script, the coders modified 
it to produce more coherent English.  Though much easier to understand, the 
Kenon language script is also not without its flaws.  Due to memory
restrictions, the range of Kenons pronouncements is rather limited.  This
often causes Kenon to repeat itself multiple times like a broken record
because it is incapable of storing more than one response at a time.  Upon
reboot Kenon develops a new grammatically correct response it repeats until
its next reboot weeks later.  With the coders growing skills, and the
ability to learn from the past failures of both the Kvark and Kenon
scripts, the next attempt at an intelligent language script should be
successful.
