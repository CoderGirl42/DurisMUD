The zealot will attempt to banish any charmed pets present by dissolving the 
energies that bind the summoned slave to this plane of existence. If the 
creature fails its saving throw and is of  elemental origin it will be sent 
back to its plane of existence, while undead slaves are destroyed. Purely
magical creations will simply cease to be.
