A number of classes on Duris still use the mana system (rather than the
memorize system).  What this means is rather than praying or memorizing
for spell slots, each spell takes a specific number of mana to cast.  If
the caster runs out of mana, or exceeds him/herself when casting a spell,
he/she will pass out for a short period of time.
