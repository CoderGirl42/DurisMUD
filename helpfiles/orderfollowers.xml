Syntax:         order &lt;petname&gt; &lt;command&gt;
                order followers &lt;command&gt;

The &quot;order&quot; command is used in two seperate ways. Classes that have the 
ability to charm mobs must &quot;order&quot; the &quot;pet&quot; to do what the player wants.

Example:        order wolf kill duck

To order multiple followers use the command &quot;order followers&quot;

Example:        order followers kill duck

The second type of &quot;order&quot; command is used by players that have purchased 
a ship. For more information on how the &quot;order&quot; command applies to ships, 
see &quot;help ships.&quot;
