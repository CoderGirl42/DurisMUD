	<title>DEATH CORPSE DYING</title>
	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
When you die, you re-enter the game at your birthplace (where you started
the game). You can retrieve your corpse  y traveling to where you died and
getting the items from inside. Each time you die you lose a percentage of
experience for your level. It is wise to be careful to avoid death when you
have recently gained a level. If the experience lost due to death is more
than you have gained in your current level, you will &quot;lose a level&quot; and the
maximum hitpoint difference between the two levels. If you were killed by
another player of an opposite racewar side, it is possible that you will
also lose &quot;Frags&quot;.
