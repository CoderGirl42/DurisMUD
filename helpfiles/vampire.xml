	<title>VAMPIRE</title>
<content>
Among the most dreaded of the undead hordes is the Vampire. Vampires are
readily identifiable by the seasoned adventurer; pallid skin, long fangs
protruding from the top of their mouths, the odor of a juicy corpse, and a
perceptible aura of pure evil. Like most undead, Vampires are only active
at nighttime or in very dark places where most mortals fear to tread. 
Vampires are notorious for draining the lifeblood of their enemies to
further their own lives and power, as well as charming less powerful
creatures to do their bidding.

Class list:       Necromancer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Warrior, Anti-Paladin,
                  Assassin, Mercenary, Thief, Dreadlord.
Statistics: 	  Vampires are extremely strong creatures, and they are
		  smarter than your average brainless corpse. A vampire's
		  true weakness is his appearance...ugly as sin.                 
Innate Abilities: ultravision, vampiric touch, bite
