The &quot;Melkivar&quot; and &quot;Railand&quot; scripts, also known as &quot;zone god scripts&quot; are
capable of interpreting user submitted zonefiles, they are capable of
generating zonefiles on their own but more often than not a large majority
of their system processes are taken up by correcting (herein known as
rewriting) user submitted zonefiles.
