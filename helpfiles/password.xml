<content>
The &quot;password&quot; option, seen at the entry menu, allows you to change your
character's password. Players should make it a rule to change their 
passwords often to avoid the unpleasantness of having someone else gain 
control of their character. It is the players' responsibility to safeguard 
themselves by ensuring that they use a different password on each MUD they 
log into. Gods are *not* responsible for any &quot;hacked&quot; or &quot;stolen&quot; 
characters.
