Syntax:  drag &lt;object&gt; &lt;direction&gt;

This command allows you to drag takeable objects, corpses, a sleeping, 
paralyzed, bound or mortally wounded person from room to room. It is good 
for hauling objects that are otherwise too heavy to move. Dragging items 
costs a lot of movement points however.
