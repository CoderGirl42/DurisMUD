Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt; | &lt;object&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       7 days, Permanent on objects
Type of spell:  Enchantment

A successful &quot;Curse&quot; cast on a person causes his or her hitroll to drop
and an increased susceptibility to almost every kind of magical attack.

&quot;Curse&quot; cast on an object makes that object undroppable. In addition, curse
will affect the stats of the object in a negative way. Because of the
nature of the spell, exactly how much the item is hurt by the spell is not
known, but rumors have circulated indicating that the change is 
significant.

Note: The effects of this spell can only be counteracted by the spell
&quot;Remove Curse.&quot;
