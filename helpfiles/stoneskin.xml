Syntax:         inn stone (for Wights)
Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt; (for spell)  | &lt;self&gt; (for innate)
Aggressive:     No
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Protection

This spell changes the skin of the victim to a stone-like consistency and 
negates almost all damage from physical attacks. It will last until either
the duration expires or a variable number of attacks (of any type, whether 
they hit or do damage) are made against the victim. The number of attacks it 
protects against varies with level and proficiency of the caster. If a 
particularily Damaging attack is made, it will provide no protection at all. 
&quot;Stone Skin&quot; does not block any damage from magical spells (though these 
attacks will 'chip away' at the protection).
