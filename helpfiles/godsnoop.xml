Syntax:  snoop &lt;victim&gt;

This command lets you see everything that the MUD sends to the
victim's screen, except for the prompt.  It is not possible to snoop
someone of equal or higher level.

Note: snooping is to be used only for clearing up problems, and not for
intruding on people's affairs. Excessive snooping is strongly frowned upon.
