This powerful spell causes a huge magical fist, five feet high, three feet
wide, to form before the caster. The fist strikes out at the victim with a
mighty blow, smashing into its target with dreadful force. The damage
sustained by the victim is not just from the crushing blow, but also from a
vicious shock wave that follows.
