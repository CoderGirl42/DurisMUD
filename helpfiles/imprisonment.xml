Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     N/A
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster 
Type of spell:  Fear

This powerful spell creates an illusionary wall around the victim. While 
the victim is encased in this wall he or she cannot attack anyone nor can 
any physical or magical damage befall them. The only way a victim can free 
themselves is by trying to move about or by someone trying to attack 
them while imprisoned. If the victim issues no commands and nobody tries
to attack them they will be imprisoned for a very long time. It is 
important to note that due to the difficult nature of this spell it requires 
that both the caster and victim not be physically engaged in combat. 

HINT for Victims: If you are caught in this spell your best bet is to just 
spam any direction until you are free, other commands work as well so you 
can experiment if you like. Once you start trying to break free you will be 
out in 2 to 4 rounds of combat in many cases.

HINT for Illusionists: If your having a hard time getting a victim out of 
combat so you can cast this spell try using your Stunning Visions spell, 
if your lucky it will hit and you should have time to imprison your 
victim before they engage anyone in combat.
