Syntax:        drop &lt;object&gt;

If you find you no longer need an item, or if you accidentally pick up the
wrong one, you can drop it on the ground. Due to the fact that leaving
items lying around is messy and causes a lot of game overhead, we suggest
that you drop, bury, hide or sell objects that you do not wish to keep.

If you feel like getting rid of all the items you are currently
carrying, you may use the command &quot;drop all.&quot;

NOTE: Items left on the ground will not be there after reboots.
