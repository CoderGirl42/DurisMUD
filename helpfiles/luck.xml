Luck is the chance of good things happening to you; how much good fortune 
or prosperity you may have. Alchemists are the class primarily in need of
luck for skills such as &quot;Forage&quot; and &quot;Craft&quot;. All other races and classes 
benefit from luck as well. When you have high luck, things will more often
go your way.
