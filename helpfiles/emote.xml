Syntax:  emote &lt;message_text&gt;
         : &lt;message_text&gt;

The &quot;emote&quot; command allows you to creatively pretend that your
character is doing something that the available socials do not
currently allow.  For example, if Fizzwig wished everyone to think he
is a really nice guy, he might type:

        emote hands you 10000 pcoins.
                -or-
        : hands you 10000 pcoins.

This would be viewed as everyone in the room as:

        Fizzwig hands you 10000 pcoins.

Of course, Fizzwig has not really given anyone the coins, he just
wants everyone to think he has.

A quicker, equivalent command is &quot;:&quot;

Note:  &quot;emote&quot; is a social action that is used for *fun*.  Please do not
take these actions seriously.
