The term &quot;Idle&quot; is used to classify when your character is logged on but no 
commands are being entered. After you are idle for 10 minutes, you will 
automatically enter the &quot;Void&quot;. After 15 minutes of idle time, you will 
&quot;Idle Rent&quot;. Your character will exit the game at whatever location he/she
is currently at. When you re-enter the game, you will start at whatever
place you were last at. This also holds true for characters who are or are 
not link-dead.
