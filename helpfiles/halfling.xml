	<title>HALFLING</title>
	<category type="General Information"/>
<content>
Halflings are remarkably small humanoids that are renowned for being
goodhearted and naive. Customarily thieves by nature, halflings are much
weaker than humans, but possess impressive dexterity and often have a
penchant towards meticulousness. Unfortunately for other beings who must
deal with them, they also have a tendency toward kleptomania. They also
possess infravision. They are the smallest of the races, and often
overlooked.

Classes:    Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Sorcerer, Thief, Mercenary, Bard &amp;
            Illusionist.
Statistics: Halflings have absolutely amazing dexterity, and tend to be
            fast on their feet as well, they are however, much weaker than
            humans, and tend not to be as smart or wise either. They are
            'cute' though, so no one tends to notice.
Innates:    Infravision
