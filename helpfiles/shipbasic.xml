<content>
A dock is much like any other shop, you use &quot;buy #&quot; and &quot;list&quot; to see what 
ships and ship accessories are available at the docks.  You can only buy 
a ship at one of the major docks in the world.  An example is Tharnadia on 
the Goodie Continent.  To buy your first ship, you must also give it a name. 
Names of ship use ANSI commands so you should first use &quot;Testcolor&quot; command 
to perfect the name of your ship, otherwise you could end up with a lousy 
looking shipname.

The syntax for buying your first ship is &quot;buy # &lt;shipname&gt;&quot; where # is 
the number of the hull you wish to purchase, and shipname is the above 
mentioned name you create using ANSI commands. 

Ok, now you've purchased your ship, the &quot;list&quot; menu at all docks will 
have changed.  You can now see 4 sections instead of just one. From now 
on, you will not have to state a shipname when you buy or upgrade your 
hull.  You are PERMANENTLY stuck with that shipname for this character.
