A Cenobite is a multi-class Druid/Cleric.

Notes on Cenobite:
Druids commune, which is heavilly based on terrain, for both spells
and commune times.
Clerics pray, and require no spellbooks or totems.
If you start as a Druid, you will commune all your spells.
If you start as a Cleric, you will pray spells.
