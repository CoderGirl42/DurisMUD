Syntax:         trip &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes

This is a skill that attempts an acrobatic maneuver of tripping an opponent 
in battle. No damage is dealt, but it can have very detrimental effects, 
such as: causing a caster to abort a spell or disorienting the opponent 
long enough for the thief to make a quick retreat.
