<content>
Illusionist are the magical masters of the unreal and the shadow. They
are capable of illusions so powerful no one can help but believe they are 
real. They are also masters of deception and many have foolishly let them
into their ranks, to their doom. Illusionist tend to be highly intelligent 
and use this to their advantage. 

Allowable races:        Human, Gnome, Halfling, Goblin, Orc, Phantom, Lich. 
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Illusionist have their 
			own specific item restrictions.  They have a
                        very small range of weapons they can use and a
                        small range of armor to choose from. They have 
                        very little restrictions on what miscellaneous 
                        magical items they can use, though.
