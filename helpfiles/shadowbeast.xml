The Shadow Beast is rumored to be a higher form of lycanthrope that was
killed in its lycanthropic state, and quickly raised as a shadow. These
spawns become naturals at the art of stealth, thievery, deception and
assassination. They delight in taking advantage of their undead state and
hellborne skills to wreak havoc upon the living.

Class list:       Thief, Assassin, Mercenary, Warrior, Unholy-Piper.
Statistics:       Shadow Beasts often appear as dark, hairy, half animal
                  half ectoplasmic humanoid that can be hard to detect at
                  times. They are very coordinated, if lacking a little in
                  physical prowess.
Innate abilities: Ultravision, UD-sneak, Enlarge, Reduce, Project Image,
                  Strength.
