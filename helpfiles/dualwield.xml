&quot;Dual Wield&quot; allows you to wield a primary AND secondary weapon and to use
both to hit your opponent during combat. This, in effect, gives you an  
extra attack per round. The success of the attack depends on your
proficiency in that particular area.

Note: While it is possible for other classes to wield two weapons at once,
they cannot practice this skill and the chances of their hitting an opponent
with a secondary weapon is very unlikely.
