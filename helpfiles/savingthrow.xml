A saving throw is a measure of your ability to withstand certain forms of
attack. Every player in the game, monsters included, has five different
saving throw values. These values are level-dependent. The five different
values are as follows:

        SPE     Save versus Spells.
        PAR     Save versus Paralyzation.
        BRE     Save versus Breath Weapon.
        FEA     Save versus Petrification/Polymorph.
        ROD     Save versus Rod/Staff/Wand.

Each of the saving throws has a value from 0 to 20.  The higher your saving
throw, the worse off you are. But what do the numbers mean?

Let's say you are in combat with a red dragon and the dragon breathes fire
at you. In this example, let's say your saving throw vs. breath weapon
(BRE) is 10. A random 20-sided die roll is made when the dragon breathes at
you. If the value of the roll is 11 or above, you have successfully saved
vs. the dragon's breath, and take only half damage from it. If the roll is
0-10, you have failed your save and will take full damage from the dragon's
fire. Thus, the lower the saving throw you have, the greater your chances
are for saving against the dragon's breath.

The same system works for spells. If, for example, a player-killer arrives
and tries to cast a &quot;sleep&quot; spell on you, and you fail your save, you will
be affected and fall asleep. If you save successfully, you will be
unaffected.

Normally, saving throws are determined by the experience your character has
achieved and they will get steadily smaller as you go up in level. There
are, however, items in the game that will lower your saving throws
magically.
