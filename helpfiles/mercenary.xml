<content>
Privateers who roam the land in a fashion similar to smugglers and thieves,
Mercenaries are a cross between a rogue and a Warrior and have some of the
skills of each. This class is known for its anti-social behavior and they
tend to be extremely selfish by nature. However, everything has its price
and they are soldiers for hire. Mercenaries typically possess more hit 
points than the waspish rogues, but are not quite as brawny as Warriors.
&gt;From long battle experience, they are more likely to hit their opponents
than either Thieves or Assassins.

Allowable races:        Human, Barbarian, Mountain Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, 
                        Duergar Dwarf, Troll, Orc, Goblin, Shadow Beast, 
                        Minotaur, Shade, Revenant, Vampire, Death Knight. 
Innate abilities:       No class-specific innate abilities.
Equipment usage:        Like all classes on Duris, Mercenaries have their
                        own classification of item restriction. They can
                        use quite a variety of weapons but are generally
                        more limited in their selection	of armor. They are
                        moderately limited in their usage of miscellaneous
                        magical items such as wands, etc.
