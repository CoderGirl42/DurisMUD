The world of Duris is made up of various &quot;zones&quot; or areas, created by a
number of different people. Each zone is normally set around a theme, and
the levels intended for zones can vary greatly. Any player on Duris can
create a zone and submit it for approval. DikuEdit makes this much more
simple for the average player. To see a current list of zones, their
levels, and builders, type &quot;credit&quot;.
