Upon choosing the path of Pyrokinetic, the psionicist is imbued with the
willpower to manipulate the flame. Under the effect of such pure focus, he
or she can greatly reduce/negate the damage from any fire based attack, or
at higher levels, absorb it completely. Also, due to their superior focus,
they can channel the power of flames directly through their detonates,
making them much more deadly.
