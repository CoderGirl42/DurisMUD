Anti-Paladins are evil knights that have fallen from grace and now serve 
the darker powers of the world as a result. They, like their good-aligned
analogs the Paladins, are hearty Fighters that possess limited spell-like
powers. These powers are granted to them by their evil deities and are used
to further advance their vile causes.

Anti-Paladins are the best horsemen in the world. At higher levels, Anti-
Paladins receive many powers, primarily offensive in nature, and can
harm opponents with a touch.  

Allowable races:        Orc, Githyanki, Death Knight, Vampire.
Innate Abilities:       Summon Mount, Detect Evil, Detect Good, Vampiric
                        Touch  
Equipment Usage:	Like all classes on Duris, Anti-Paladins have their
                        own set of equipment they can use. Anti-Paladins
                        can use most weapons and armor,	but are rather
                        limited in their use of magic items.
