Syntax:         toggle nchat

Setting this option ON will allow you to hear and converse on the &quot;Newbie&quot; 
chat channel. This is a useful feature for those first starting out on Duris 
or those that are new to mudding in general. 

NOTE: After achieving a specified number of levels, &quot;Nchat&quot; will no longer
      be available to you. 
NOTE: If you are a higher level player with an interest in helping new
      players to the game by providing useful information and answering
      questions on nchat, please contact a god and have this channel 
      activated for you.
