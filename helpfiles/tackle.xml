Syntax:         tackle &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes

A successful tackle will knock the victim down for a duration, causing both 
you and the victim to be unable to respond to any commands for a short
period of time. If you fail to tackle successfully, you will lose your 
balance and fall to the ground. Some creatures may not be susceptible to a 
tackle, due to size or other considerations. Unlike bash, tackle may be 
used on any type of terrain.
