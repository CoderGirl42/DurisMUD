If the Necromancer has a suitable corpse at his feet, &quot;Raise Wraith&quot; causes 
the corpse to return to existence as a wraith. Wraiths by nature are 
Sorcerers, but their power varies from animation to animation. They are 
somewhat physically weak and cannot withstand much damage to their fragile 
forms, but they have the potential to be deadly foes.
