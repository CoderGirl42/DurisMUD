Syntax:         camp

When you are adventuring by road, it is often not advantageous to continue
your journey through the night, so Duris has a &quot;Camp&quot; option. Locate a safe 
place to camp for the night and then type &quot;camp&quot;. You must then wait a
period of time before you can exit the game. If you leave the room in which 
you are trying to set up camp or if you fight, camping will automatically
cancel. Once you fully camp, you will be sent to the main menu, just as 
when you rent.

<R>Warning</R>: If you go link-dead, camping will stop (linkdead rent does 
        *not* reset your homeroom).
