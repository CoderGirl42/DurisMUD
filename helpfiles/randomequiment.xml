<content>
The chaotic nature of Duris manifest's itself in the spontaneous creation
of creatures, areas and equipment in places not generally found.

Random Equipment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These items are forged by the swirl of powers inherent upon that moment of
death, and can occasionally be found on the corpses of defeated creatures.

Random Mobs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tossed through the ether from latent world magic's gone awry, creatures far
from home can be found wandering lost on the lands. Beware approaching 
these bewildered souls, as fear may drive them past all reasoning and
sanity into beings of unrivaled aggression and power.

Random Zones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Powerful shifts and changes within the earth's crust toss up areas from the
depths. Still half buried, these require a shovel and some hard digging
before they can be accessed and explored to find what treasures and beasts
may lurk hidden and lie within.
