When cast on an elemental plane, this spell allows the Druid to temporarily
possess some properties of that plane. The specific properties vary from
plane to plane, although, rumors tell that most planes possess statistical
elements and many others. There is also a chance that the caster will 
achieve FULL elemental form, infusing them with added powers.
