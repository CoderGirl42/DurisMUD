	<title>ENCRUST</title>
<content>
Encrusting is one of the highly sought after skills of the Alchemist Class.
By collecting various rare gems, the alchemist can bind into other
equipment items the power of these stones.

The stones themselves can sometimes be found in the corpses of the more
fearsome and hard to kill creatures of Duris.

You will need to make sure that the equipment item and the stone you wish
to use for the &quot;encrust&quot; are both in your inventory then type:

     encrust item stone

For example if you have &quot;a strange Green stone&quot;, and &quot;a steel dagger&quot;, just
make sure both are in your inventory then type: encrust dagger stone

Warning: Encrusting an item, overwrites all existing proc's for that item.
