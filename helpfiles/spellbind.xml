Syntax: &lt;spellbind item_name&gt;
	&lt;spellbind&gt; Lets the alchemist see accumulated power

With this powerful enchantment skill the alchemist can empower an item
with mystical energies enhancing the properties of the item. The rate to 
which the item is improved is based on the level and skill of the 
alchemist. The first stat of the item will also be raised more than the 
second stat of the item.

When an item has been enchanted the magical energies make it impossible to
repair. Even a failed attempt will render the item unrepairable. There is 
also a chance that the item will be damaged in the process.

In order to gain the power necessary to spellbind items the alchemist needs 
to harvest power by killing creatures greater than 10 levels below his own 
level. The alternative is to gain this power by fragging. With each 0.1 
frags the alchemist can spellbind one item.
