Instruments are a necessity of a bard and needed to create magical affects.
The bard must first be holding the appropriate instrument and then type
'play &lt;songname&gt;'.  The various instruments are as follows:  flute, harp,
horn, drums, lyre, mandolin.  Unlike spells, the music played by a bard 
is continuous when the bard begins playing and will continue until he/she
ends the song or begins a new song.  Songs do eventually end, of course.
