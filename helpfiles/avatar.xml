An Avatar is created by the spell &quot;channel&quot;, which requires four clerics
over level 50 to create. All four clerics begin casting the spell until the
avatar appears. It is then led by the lead cleric while the other three
clerics can only watch. The avatar itself is a level 56 cleric/warrior mob,
capable of all the spells and skills of those classes. The four clerics
themselves are left in a state of sleep until the avatar is lost or dies,
and their actual bodies are in no danger if the avatar is attacked.

Warning: If ANY one of the clerics that created the avatar loses link, the
avatar will be lost.
