The gaping empty sockets of the Dreadlord may be sightless, but its gaze
contains something much more searching, disturbing and terrifying than most
mortals may bear. To have the gaze of a Dreadlord upon you is to know true
fear. Too petrified to move, your world ceasing and stopping as you
struggle to free and turn away. The ability to gaze is dependant on the 
attribute power of the attacker. It is not crucial but will help subdue 
the victim.
