&quot;poofin &lt;text&gt;&quot; sets up the message for when you &quot;goto&quot; a room. This
replaces the default &quot;ear-splitting bang&quot; message we are used to seeing. To
get the default back, just type poofin with no argument.

&quot;Poofout&quot; is the same as poofin, except is is the message seen by people in
the room you are leaving when you do a &quot;goto.&quot;

To see what your current poofin/-out is, type &quot;poofin ?&quot; or &quot;poofout?&quot;
