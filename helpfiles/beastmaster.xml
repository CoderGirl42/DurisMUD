A Beastmaster is a multi-class Shaman/Druid.

Notes on Beastmaster:
Shamans use totems, and memorize spells without spellbooks.
Druids commune, which is heavilly based on terrain, for both spells
and commune times.
If you start as a Druid, you will commune all of your spells.
If you start as a Shaman, you will memorize spells, but you will no longer
need totems, for ANY of your spells.
