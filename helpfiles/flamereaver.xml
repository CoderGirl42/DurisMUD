The Flame Reaver has mastered the use of <r>fi</r><R>re</R> and it shows in their 
abilities. They gain the power to shroud themselves in fire and to unleash
fireballs by drawing upon the power of their flaming swords. They may also
tap into the fiery shroud surrounding them to send out waves of incendiary
gates at their opponents, though this will drain the shroud until it finally
will dissipate.
