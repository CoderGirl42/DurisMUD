Smelting is one of the skills known to the Alchemist Class. It allows you
to merge pieces of ore into larger ones. This is helpful in order to fulfil
the requirements needed to forge various items.

A foundry is required to smelt ore, this can be innately created by any
alchemist.

To smelt ore simply follow these steps:
   Create a foundry.
   Open the forge.
   Put the ore you wish to smelt into the forge.
   Smelt the ore.

The syntax for using this skill is <Y>smelt</Y>.

Both the skill in smelting and level of the alchemist will determine how
successful the outcome is. It is well known that less experienced
alchemists often end up with nothing but ashes when trying to use
this skill.
