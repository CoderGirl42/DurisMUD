&quot;Animal Vision&quot; enhances the casters vision and eyesight, allowing them to
see things they would normally not. The extra visionary senses that are 
gained by this spell are entirely dependent upon the type of terrain it is 
cast within. It is rumored that this spell becomes even more potent once the 
caster has reached the upper levels of their craft.
