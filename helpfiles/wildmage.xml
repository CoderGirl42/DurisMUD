	<title>WILDMAGE</title>
<content>
The chaos mage will draw power from beyond reality, from the realm of Chaos.
This realm has immense power reserves but it is very hard to control. This 
will manifest itself by letting the mage get random results (often more 
powerful) when he casts his spell. The drawback is that he can loose control 
over the strong magic and harm random people in the room, be it friend of foe.
