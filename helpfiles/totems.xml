Totems are required by Shamans to cast their spells, as they allow them to
focus their energies into magic.

Shaman spells are divided into &quot;spheres&quot; -animal, elemental, and
spiritual. Lesser totems are used to cast spells in a certain sphere below
6th circle, while greater totems are used to cast those spells 6th and
over. Totems can also grant more than one sphere or high/low-level spells.
Totems must be held while casting (but not required during memorizing).

Newbie Shamans load with three totems (raven, limestone, ivory), each of
which grants the lower spells for a certain sphere. (raven =animal,
limestone =elemental, ivory =spiritual).

Higher totems can be bought at various Shaman-related stores around the
mud, as well as created by the &quot;Minor Creation&quot; spell.
