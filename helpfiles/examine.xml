Syntax:         examine &lt;victim&gt; | &lt;object&gt;

&quot;Examine&quot; may give you some valuable information about an item or 
character. It will also tell you what is inside a container, if it is open.  
When there is more than one object or character of the same name in the 
room and you wish to examine each one, use the following example as a 
guideline:

You are in a room and you see:

        An ugly, drooling frog is standing here.
        An ugly, drooling frog is standing here.
        An ugly, drooling frog is standing here.

You wish to examine each one.  You would type:

        examine frog
        examine 2.frog
        examine 3.frog
