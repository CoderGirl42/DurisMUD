Area of effect: &lt;victim&gt;
Aggressive:     Yes
Cumulative:     No
Duration:       Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell:  Enchantment

Using the power of his mind, the caster disrupts the victims' brains'
ability to communicate with the rest of his central nervous system.
This causes the victim to have trouble travelling about, and
in extreme cases, makes it harder for them to escape from combat.
