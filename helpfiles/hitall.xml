Syntax:         hitall          : hit aggressive monsters
                hitall all      : hit all monsters

This skill allows you to hit all foes in the room simultaneously. Each
target may be hit once and only once, regardless of proficiency in &quot;dual 
wield&quot; or &quot;double attack.&quot;  Using &quot;hitall&quot;, will cause you to be stunned for
several rounds of combat, with the amount depending on how many targets you
attempted to hit.
