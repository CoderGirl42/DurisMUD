Syntax:   exp (to see how much experience you currently have)

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. Once 
you have earned enough experience, you raise a level in your class. Duris 
has 56 mortal levels; you can check your progress by typing 'experience'.  
The levels after 50 are only received by quaffing a specific potion, found 
in zones.

Here are a few things you should know about experience points:

	-Each pulse you hit or miss a monster when you are engaged
	  you get experience points. 
	-Healing a person who is in combat and grouped with you will 
	  give you a lot of experience points.
   	-You get exp for each spell you cast upon a monster or a player
	  in your group if you are in combat. The amount of experience
 	  points received depends on which circle the spells is in. You
	  also receive experience points for using skills in combat, such
	  as bash, backstab, kick and so on.
	-If you kill a monster of a higher level than yourself, you get 
 	  bonus experience points.
	-If you kill a monster of a lower level, you will gain less 
          experience points.
