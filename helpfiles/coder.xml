Coders of the MUD are a series of self correcting algorithms, usually the
process is started by a smaller script such as the &quot;Alver&quot;, &quot;Dvorak&quot; or 
&quot;Nokz&quot; scripts. These work fine for most features but occasionally enter 
higher level functions and cause additional &quot;features&quot; which then need to 
pass through the &quot;Tharkun&quot; or &quot;Ilienze&quot; functions which restore the 
functions to their original code then rewrite them from scratch. The fabled 
Foo is a mostly unknown to Duris, but oddly his name is scratched to the 
bottom of each boat. If a Foo appears, most coder scripts will accept his 
function calls, except the &quot;Kvark&quot;.
