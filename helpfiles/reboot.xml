The term &quot;reboot&quot; refers to when the game is manually shut down for a short
period of time and restarted. Restarting the game causes all monsters,
areas and equipment to be reloaded as if the game had not been touched. If
a reboot occurs while you are logged on, you will reappear after the reboot
in the same location as you were immediately before the reboot. This is
independent of where you last rented.

The term &quot;crash&quot; refers to when the games simply shuts down without warning
due to reasons outside of the gods' control. As in a reboot, all monsters,
areas, and equipment will load after a crash. The main difference between
the two is that you will appear in the game at the last place that you
rented or camped following a crash.

PLAYER CORPSES WILL RE-LOAD FOLLOWING A REBBOT OR CRASH. REIMBURSEMENTS
FOR DYING BEFORE EITHER WILL NOT BE GIVEN. CORPSES WILL DECAY AS NORMAL.
THERE ARE NO REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ITEMS &quot;LOST&quot; DUE TO A REBOOT OR CRASH.
