Syntax:  testcolor &lt;color-code containing text&gt;

This command allows you to see what a particular string (with color
codes, probably) will look like.  Using this command, you can test out
ship names, titles, and the like before actually applying them for all
eternity.  The color code-interpreted text is shown only to you, exactly
as it will appear on the mud.
