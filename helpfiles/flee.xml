Syntax:         flee

If, for instance, the minor daemon you so carefully considered turns out to 
be a little more than you bargained for, you can attempt to escape by using 
the &quot;Flee&quot; command. This command, if successful, will allow you to leave 
the room via the nearest exit, if there is one. However, some monsters will 
hunt you down in various manners to try and continue the fight, so be 
warned.

Fleeing is not an effortless action. Extracting yourself from a life or 
death struggle takes energy, so you will eat up your personal stamina in 
such attempts. You will lose a significant amount of moves on a flee.
