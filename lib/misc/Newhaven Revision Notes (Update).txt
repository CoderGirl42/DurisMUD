Lohrr:
  This doesn't replace the last update file, as that had actual
ideas in it toward the mud on a whole, and a rather pedantic 
CV from me.  ;)  In other words, I hope when you get the chance 
you at least read the old update file in its entirety and maybe
get some ideas worth implementing.  This just explains the changes 
made to the area since it was installed, and what needs to be fixed 
via code.


Newhaven Rewrite
-----------------
Newhaven Specific Problems:
 1) [Fixed] Missing !Mob Rooms to limit where mobs roam.
 2) [Fixed] All Undead are now Aggro-All at Night.
 3) [Fixed] Moved skeletal remains obj to the zombie of the blacksmith's assistant (~lvl30), and upped reward to flat 50k.
 4) [Fixed] Moved one of the two blackberries deeper into the evil side so it wasn't so easy to get.
 5) [Fixed] Set all mobs that are marked as !Standing in their long descriptions to position:whatever, default_position:standing.
    This is as per the sleeping seamstresses in Harrow.  As I said in my IM, the code is bugged and needs to be addressed (see below).  
 6) [Added] Added warrior/caster versions of the items the armorer crafts for money and objects (quest).
 7) [Fixed] Fixed ansi on fishing rod and the quest that mention it.
 8) [Added] You can now fish at the waterfall.
 9) [Fixed] Added to the quest chatter to finish the zone's story as well as animate Vulgaris.  You now learn through mob_chat that
    the librarian summoned the Erinyes who then created the undead duplication of Newhaven.
10) [Partial Fixed] Derth of scenery mobs for lowbs.  Added another cat/skeletal_cat combo, as well as some small lizard mobs.
11) [Added] Added a new mining pick item (exact stats as heavens.zon pick... just different ansi).  Kinda like the fishing rod.  
    You might need to add this to the code so it works.  Also, you
    will need to refix the rod so it works. 
12) [Added] Expanded items that Dibbly will purchase.  Making his store a lil more useful.
13) [Fixed] Court Room mobs should remain in court room.
14) [Fixed] Lowered the chance mobs speak (I think, as there really is no documentation on how that shit works).
15) [Fixed] Moved the lizard tail from the gate to the deepest lizard in the undead part of the zone.  Players will now need to hunt
    thru all the lizards to find the tail if they want a chance at getting their bracer made.
16) [Added] A pouch of coins has been added to the gate to replace the tail object.  This is the pouch loaded on the map on both the
    goodie and evil continents which contains 90g and 100s.
17) [Added] Two grates (one on each side) that exit out to the surface.  This is a lowbie zone, a single wall shouldn't be enough to lock
    in and grief players.  The living side's grate exits to the forest west of town (room #552844), while the undead side's grate leads to
    the hills east of town (room #552052).  They are both one way.  I wish there were a way to make them select randomly from a list of 2
    to 5 different target rooms.  Would allow for less chance of the target rooms being walled off as well.  Also added descriptions in
    room to indicate they exist.
18) Made the meat pies takeable.
19) Added !Sleep to the Veldian Collar.


Changes Requiring Lohrr
-----------------------
1) Didn't know what level poison you flagged blackberries, so you will need reflag them.
2) New Mining Pick and Fishing Rod need to be made functional.
3) Problems with position code:
    - As I originally thought, what is happening is they are loading as seated, but then stand (since only sleeping prevents a mob
      from attempting to stand).  The code should prevent the NPC from leaving its load position (position in DE) unless there is a 
      fight in room or they are attacked (like sleeping mobs), upon which they abandon using the long_description provided in DE,
      and revert to "<short_name_capitalized> <position>."... Basically, the same code used to show players positioning.  This is 
      how Tavril originally coded it to work, but I think he only did so for sleeping position.  When the mob (re)loads it should
      load in the DE position:whatever and use the DE-set long_description.  Sorry, brother.  But this is really the only big code 
      change required.  I dunno how this affects the sleeping antelope in Centaur Villages, as they have been reset to both 
      position:sleeping and default_position:sleeping.  When the zone went in 23 years ago flagged like that, the mobs would wake when
      hit and then instantly go back to sleep, making them basically just hitting posts.
